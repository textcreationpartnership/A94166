            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     </hi> Preſent you theſe firſt-fruits of my poor labours, as a pledge of my love, and teſtimony of my unfeigned deſires, and longings after your ſettlement, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort together. I am indeared to you in the bowels of Chriſt, and for his ſake ow my ſelf unto you: My higheſt ambition in this world is, to ſee you ſtabliſhed in truth, and flouriſhing in the glorious graces of the Goſpel. I have treated on theſe two ſubjects, becauſe I know they are the tempting errours of theſe Times, and have the faireſt gloſſes ſet on them, and have too much influence to diſturb the Peace and Order of Churches: The firſt eſpecially,
<pb facs="tcp:169965:4"/> which eats out mens affections, and creeps at the heart like a gangrene inſenſibly; an opinion which hath been always ominous, and of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſtrange influence, accompanied with the moſt dangerous retinue of errours, ſince the firſt Embrio of it was brought forth; whether by a judgement of God, or from its natural and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret connexion with other principles of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I will not determine; only God hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome black characters on it in every Nation where it hath prevailed; though we cannot but ſay, many Saints are innocently under the power of it.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, I hope when mens hearts come in Tune, their voyces will likewiſe: The former denies more Fundamental Principles, as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in its extent, and ſubjects; the freeneſs of Grace; the riches of its workings in the New Teſtament; and contracts the Goſpel; leaving more Grace viſible in the Legal and Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſpenſation, then in the New.</p>
                  <p>I have only ſummed up what others expreſs more at large, with ſomething new, and never yet touched, that I know of: And as to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
<pb facs="tcp:169965:4"/> all is new, and made fit for your uſe, if Chriſt ſet it home on you. I have nothing elſe to add, but to tell you, you have been yet kept pure in the midſt of many Diſtractions, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of deſperate Opinions: Take heed of plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible errours that come painted to you with the name of the moſt glorious truths: Loſe not your glory at laſt; try and weigh every tittle that is propounded: It's my deſire you may have the glorious Title given to you the <hi>Bereans</hi> had, to be (<gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Severall Conſiderations premiſed, as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to the Diſcourſe.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>EFORE I enter on the main que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions handled in this Diſcourſe, it will not be unneceſſary to premiſe ſomething in general concerning this Controverſy, which is ſuch a bone of contention among the Saints, for to make our way clear before us.</p>
                  <p>And 1. Let this be conſidered, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all the N. T. againſt the baptizing of Infants, not one hint from any expreſs word dropt from Chriſt or his Apoſtles; not one phraſe, which though never ſo much ſtrain'd, doth forbid ſuch an act; but there is much for it in divers Scriptures compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and what is wanting in the one, is ſupplyed in another abundantly, as hereafter will appear.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:169965:6"/>2. The ſum of all that our Oppoſites have to ſay, though they make a great deal of noiſe in the World, is only this, that they can find no ſyllabical precept, or word of command in terms, ſaying, Go baptize Infants; or any poſitive example where it is ſaid in ſo many words, Infants were baptized; only actual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as they believed, were baptized: all that they ſay beſides, is only to quarrel with our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and make ſhift to evade the ſtrength of them: but this is their only argument, and their all; for however they talk of the Covenant, and fleſhly and ſpiritual ſeed, yet this is the <hi>Goliahs</hi> ſword, none like to it; I would therfore fairly encounter with it in the Portall, that I may ſee all their ſtrength before me.</p>
                  <p>Concerning which, take in theſe conſiderations: Firſt, this argument is built on this falſe principle, That no direct conſequences from Scripture are man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory, and ſo obliging, nor of Divine Authority, which all Orthodox Profeſſors and Divines grant, but theſe which are againſt Infants baptiſm; and it is moſt clear: for,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The way to know Scriptures, is by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13. and this muſt needs be by their Harmonie, and by deduction from one to another.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Without True conſequence were as Scripture, no one could ſpeak truth but theſe that ſpeak juſt the very expreſſions of Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There could be no ſpiritual reaſons nor argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments uſed in any Diſcourſe to be of any force or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169965:6"/> conſequence, though from the Scripture; for there can be no arguing from Scripture, but by conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and deduction; for in all arguments there muſt be a medium and a concluſion, a propoſition and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nothing upon this account can be Scripture but the very letters and ſyllables in the Bible; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the meaning or ſenſe is Scripture; for you muſt draw out the ſenſe and meaning from the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by rational conſequence, as the concluſion from a propoſition by a fit medium; and how abſurd would this prove, that letters ſhould be Scripture, and not the ſenſe? and ſo it muſt be according to that Maxim of theirs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This is againſt all preaching, and expounding Scripture; nothing muſt be read but the very bare characters for to draw any deductions from; it is to no purpoſe, though never ſo direct and full; for if they be not Scripture, they cannot bind conſciences; and to what end is preaching, but to open and apply Scripture?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſearchings of the Scripture were the moſt uſeleſs undertaking that could be imagined; for what need I ſearch, but read? for no conſequence, by compariſon of Scripture, is of authority to ſatisfie my conſcience, if I draw a concluſion from a text, and perceive the meaning of it to be thus; if nothing without it be laid down in ſo many ſyllables, how many ſuch ſtrange abſurdities would follow the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying conſequences from Scripture, which are purely
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169965:7"/> deducted? and by this principle, that where there are not ſo many letters put together in one ſentence, there is no command, men would ſoon draw Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion into a very narrow compaſs.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This would be as much againſt themſelves; For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They have no command in ſo many words, Go and baptize actual or viſible believers: if they ſay ſuch were baptized: it's anſwered, that is not to the purpoſe: for it's a verball command required by them to give warrant to an ordinance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That</hi> they muſt prove by conſequence alſo, believers were baptized, <hi>Ergo</hi> there was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: Neither,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Can they prove one act concerning their own form of baptizing by any command, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences: When they ſay Infants are not to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, they draw it from conſequence thus, becauſe there is no command in their ſenſe; When they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Covenant is not made with believers now, and their ſeed, as with <hi>Abraham,</hi> it's drawn by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, becauſe, ſay they, <hi>Abraham</hi> is no natural father to us, as to the Jews, and becauſe that covenant was a mixt Covenant, &amp;c. When they come to prove baptizing to be by plunging, they argue by conſequence, becauſe the word ſignifies it, becauſe they went where much water was, and went down into the water, &amp;c. though they are miſtaken in all their conſequences, as I ſhall hereafter ſhew; yet this is full <hi>ad hominem,</hi> and againſt themſelves,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169965:7"/> who deny conſequences to warrant inſtitutions, and yet have nothing for to prove their own way, but what is by conſequence from Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It's common among the Apoſtles to argue in ſuch a method, and to deduce one thing from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, to make out what they intended; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>We thus judge, if Chriſt died for all, then all are dead;</hi> if the firſt be true, then the latter; ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. and all that Chapter, arguing out the reſurrection by fit me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums: ſo about the Ordinance of Baptiſm, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. <hi>Can any man forbid water, why theſe ſhould not be baptized, who have received the holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> There was never any command to baptize theſe that had received the holy Ghoſt, nor any example of any baptized on theſe terms; but the Apoſtle argues from the equivalency of the mercy, and the reaſon of the ſtate they were in; the ſame method he uſes 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.15, 16, 17, 18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17, 18.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. There will be hardly found a definition of the moſt doctrinal and high myſteries of the Goſpel, but by comparing Scripture with Scripture, and ſo making it forth by conſequence: what perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of juſtification, or of juſtifying faith, in ſo many formall expreſſions in all the N. T. but what muſt be deducted by comparing Scriptures together to make one reſult? where are women either by ſuch a wordy expreſſion commanded to receive the Lords Supper? or any example? if they ſay (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>)
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169965:8"/> ſignifies both ſexes, yet it's ſtill by conſequence, no command or example: and why not (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) as fit to ſignifie Infant-Saints, as grown Saints, Infant-holineſs, as perfect holineſs? it's applyed to both; if they will ſtick at a ſyllable, we may ſtick with them on the ſame grounds.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Deny conſequences to have the ſtrength of commands, and you will leave very few duties to be practis'd, or ſins to be avoided, in the Old or New Teſtament: Expound the ten Commandments, the ſum of the Law, without conſequences, and very few ſhall be found literal tranſgreſſors, but moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate debauched perſons. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. Chriſt expounds the whole Law, and by conſequences from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meaning, draws out new conſiderations of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and ſince the Bible is but a ſhort ſyſteme of Religion, every place is fitted to expound each other; and this muſt be done by rational-ſpiritual compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and inferences; but enough to the firſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this head of commands and conſequences.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where we have a promiſe laid as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a duty, that is equivalent to any expreſs command; for as commands in the Goſpel do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe promiſes, to encourage us to act them, and help us in them: ſo promiſes made to perſons do include commands, eſpecially when the duties commanded are annexed to the promiſes, as all New Teſtament Ordinances are, as well as Old.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We have as much in the N. T. to prove In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſm, from the true principles of right to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169965:8"/> Ordinances, as they have for theſe whom they ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize; for they baptize grown perſons on ſuch and ſuch conſiderations; and we ſhall hereafter ſhew, we baptize on as ſtrong and equivalent grounds; and that's enough to warrant a command, to demonſtrate the ſame ſubſtantial grounds of the command to reach the ſame caſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If we can find no poſitive command in ſo many words for their baptizing (ſhewing the ſame fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental grounds) it's requiſite they ſhould ſhew us ſome expreſs command to the contrary, and ſome authentique repeal, ſeeing Infants ſo long enjoyed ſuch a like Ordinance: upon the ſame grounds Chriſt would not have taken away ſuch an antient priviledge, when his grace abounded, and ſuper-abounded, but he would have left ſome characters of it in the Goſpel, and entred ſome formal diſcharge in his Word of ſuch perſons, and given a warning of it to the Gentile believers to expect it; but he hath both by his words and carriages left clear demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, that he is ſo far from repealing, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it to Infants; let the Scriptures opened here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſpeak to this.</p>
                  <p>The third Conſideration premiſed is this, as all that they urge as to examples of actual believers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized, all along the New Teſtament, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>Acts,</hi> and that if thou believeſt thou mayſt, &amp;c. we can freely grant without any damage to this truth: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We ſay as they, profeſſing believers, grown
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169965:9"/> men were firſt baptized, and ſo they ought to be, who are to be the firſt ſubjects of the adminiſtration of an Ordinance, perſons able to give an account of their own faith; it was ſo with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24. he was 99 years old when he was circumciſed. and he muſt be firſt circumciſed before he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey a right to his ſeed; now you may as well argue, <hi>Abraham</hi> was firſt circumciſed when ſo old, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore old perſons are to be circumciſed, and none elſe; as becauſe grown perſons were baptized, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not Infants, when they muſt be firſt baptized themſelves; for Children are baptized by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe firſt to them, and in them to their ſeed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An affirmative poſition is not excluſive of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinates; becauſe believers were ſaid to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, <hi>Ergo</hi> not their ſeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not true reaſoning; for their ſeed were comprehended with them in the ſame promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>A non dicto ad non factum, non valet conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> as Divines ſay; becauſe it's not expreſt in ſo many words, therefore it was not done, is no argument; eſpecially when there is enough to ſhew it was done, though not written; Chriſt ſpeaks ſhort, that we may ſearch; he expects N. T. Saints to be ſo ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to take more by a hint, then thoſe of the Old who were not ſo bred as we now; they had every pin of the Tabernacle appointed; it's not ſo pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually ſet down now, either as to Churches, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but only the main Subſtantials laid down, and it's left to the ingenuity of the Saints to draw forth the conſequences.</p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:169965:9"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, to premiſe no more; God hath alwaies ordained ſome Ordinances; in the adminiſtration of which, for the moſt part, the ſubject hath been pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſive, to expreſs his own free grace moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, as Circumciſion on Infants: And can we think he hath left no Ordinance now as a viſible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, only to hold forth his meer grace in the N. T. where he reigns by grace? And there is no ſign ſo fit to expreſs it as Baptiſm, and no ſubject ſo capable as poor Infants.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE firſt great thing in this Controverſy is, to conſider the nature of the Covenant, which is the firſt foundation of the priviledge to believers, and their ſeed, as it was firſt made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, in the name of all believers, and their ſeed, both Jews and Gentiles; for ſo large is the extent of that Covenant to both, as hereafter ſhall be proved from New Teſtament expreſſions; and if we find the ſame Covenant reaching Gentile-believers, and their Children, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and his, we cannot be denied the new external ſign and ſeal of the ſame
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169965:10"/> Covenant; for though the outward ſigns may be changed, yet there is no change of the priviledges, if the Covenant remain entire. For the opening of which we ſhall conſider,

                        <item>2. How perſons may be ſaid to be in that Covenant.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt, we muſt begin with that place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. where God began not only to expreſs the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in larger terms then formerly, but to adde a viſible ſeal to it, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Circumciſion: There be many conjectures about this Covenant; thoſe that differ, conceive it to be a mixt Covenant, made up of ſpiritual and temporal bleſſings together, and not of the ſame purity with the Covenant in the New Teſtament, and ſo make a carnal part, and a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual part of it, and Circumciſion to be annexed eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the former, not ſo to the latter; this is the true relation of their judgement about this. Let us review the Covenant, and its terms, and we ſhall ſoon find the miſtake.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, and chiefly, We affirm this was a Covenant of pure grace, the ſame in ſubſtance with the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant adminiſtred now under the Goſpel, ſince Chriſts coming in the fleſh and ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was founded upon pure grace, Gods love to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and 'tis not any thing in <hi>Abraham,</hi> or his, to move God more then to the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It was a Covenant without works, therefore of pure grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. and all along the Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:169965:10"/>3. It was a Covenant made only with a believer upon Goſpel terms; the ſame the New Teſtament holds forth in the 3, 4, and 5, v. of that Chapter; now faith is the only condition of the Covenant of grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It was a Covenant made in Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a pure Covenant of grace, as any can be in the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18, and 29.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Conſider the tenure of this Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee in their generations, to be a God to thee, and thy ſeed after thee.</hi> Here is the ſubſtance and ſtrength of this Covenant, to be a God to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and to his ſeed; and what can be more then to be <hi>Jehovah</hi> to him? can there be any expreſſion more high, or that can ſet forth more grace in purity then this? It's more then can be expreſt, that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth his Deity to him; and it is as much as if God had ſaid, whatever I am in mine own Godhead, I will be to thee and thy ſeed, to make you happy and bleſſed: this is the firſt and main thing premiſed, and it comprehends Chriſt, grace, glory, all bleſſings above imagination; the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. uſeth the ſame expreſſion as the ſum of all, when he ſpeaks of the new Covenant, <hi>I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people.</hi> We need adde no more, if that were not a Covenant of pure grace, the Goſpel knows none other.</p>
                  <p>That which they have to ſay why it's a mixt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and a temporall, as ſome of the moſt ignorant
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169965:11"/> affirm, is from the following expreſſion of <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.8. <hi>And I will give unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee, the Land wherein thou art a ſtranger, all the Land of</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, <hi>for an everlaſting poſſeſſion, &amp;c.</hi> Now, ſay they, if the promiſes be mixt, ſo is the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, that the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſuch like promiſes, were but additional, and added <hi>ex ſuperabundanti,</hi> to the firſt promiſe, not at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated to the bulk and body of the Covenant which was made in Chriſt, and conſiſted of more pure conſiderations; theſe promiſes were but fitted to the outward adminiſtration of the firſt promiſe of grace, and the ſtate of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, but there was no mixture; For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> is repeated in the New Teſtament entire, without any of thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as is proved formerly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The promiſe of <hi>Canaan</hi> was typical of Heaven, and ſo did but more open the firſt promiſe, to be their God; ſhewing them that God would bring him and his to Heaven, and the fulneſs of his glory, as he would bring them to an outward <hi>Canaan;</hi> and this was ſuited to Gods deſign, in adminiſtring that vaſt promiſe by types and outward figures: ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> cloſed in with it by faith, as a promiſe expounding figuratively the ſubſtance of the Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8, 9, 10. ſo 13, 14, 15, 16. So that the firſt promiſe was poſitive, and ſhewed the nature of the Covenant; the other was typically expoſitory, <hi>Canaan</hi> ſetting out Heaven, and the eternity of their reſt with this
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169965:11"/> God in Covenant; and this will no more make a mixt Covenant, then the type and the ſubſtance when they meet together will differ in ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We may as well ſay, theſe promiſes in the New Teſtament make up a mixt Covenant, and ſo of a different nature, when God ſaith in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdome of God, and all things elſe ſhall be added;</hi> and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Godlineſs hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of this life, and that which is to come;</hi> which are as much mixt as ever the Covenant made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was; whereas all know, theſe are but accidental appendixes of the promiſe of grace, and diſpenſed according to the uſe he hath for, and the conditions of his Saints: thus <hi>Canaan</hi> was added to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as all other things to the Kingdome of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If this be a mixt Covenant, becauſe <hi>Canaan</hi> is added, and the like, then how comes it to be the ſame in the N. T. and to be of force now, when no notice is taken of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the temporal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes? Sure in this mixture the promiſe of free grace was primary, and like oyl, at top; for <hi>Abrahams</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant the very ſame for ſubſtance, is clear, and without mixture in the Goſpel, though it is admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred externally, as it was then, and the bleſſings of <hi>Abraham</hi> come on the Gentiles, though not of an external <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they ſay that <hi>Canaan</hi> was added only for the diſpenſation of the Covenant to the Jews, it's grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but that it ſhould make a mixture in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169965:12"/> is moſt falſe, which is the ſame for ever, though the outward adminiſtration be different; things may be added, yet not mixt, as a mans cloaths to his body, and yet there is no mixture between a mans fleſh and his cloaths.</p>
                  <p>But let us come to Circumciſion, the ſeal of this Covenant; it ſealed it, ſay they, as a mixt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>Then 1. It ſealed the one part as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; take it in their own ſenſe, that is, it ſealed God to be their God, as <hi>Canaan;</hi> and ſo it was not a ſeal meerly to a temporal promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Covenant was ſo mixt in the nature of it, then Circumciſion ſealed unequally, though it was added to a mixt Covenant, for it ſealed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of <hi>Canaan</hi> to thoſe that never went into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> as many that died before that time, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards many that were circumciſed died in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and under Gods wrath, and ſo ſealed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, neither part of the Covenant viſibly; and that is hard, that to ſo many there ſhould be neither the fulfilling of ſpiritual, nor temporal part of the promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Grant them this Covenant was mixt, then it was either in the ſubſtance, or circumſtances; if in the ſubſtance, then <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant was not Goſpel, and believers muſt ſeek for another Father, as to the example of faith, and that were to make it rather like <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image of Iron and Clay, then made up of Goſpel materials; If in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:169965:12"/> of adminiſtration, and additaments of external types, it's granted, and we have the ſame promiſe now, with new outward adminiſtrations; if this mixture were in the nature and ſubſtance of the Covenant, then it muſt remain as long as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant laſted, and ſo unto this day; for no man is ſo bold (though many are bold enough) as to ſay that <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant is abrogated; if it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any other conſideration, it's eaſily waved, and the truth the ſame: So that Circumciſion ſealed the Covenant primarily in its nature, as a Covenant of grace, and God being a God to circumciſe their hearts, &amp;c. and <hi>Canaan,</hi> and other things conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and accidentally, as God made a promiſe of them, for the better viſible adminiſtration of the Covenant to them in that external polity. And ſurely it's beyond an ordinary reach to believe, that God ſhould make a Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and for his faith in it ſhould create him the Father of the faithful in all ages, and this Covenant ſhould be brought in the N. T. and renewed, and the tenure of it freſhly held forth to believers there, and yet at the firſt making of it God ſhould mix temporal promiſes with the ſpiritual ſubſtance of it, and annex a ſeal that ſhould only or ſpecially ſeal the temporal part of it, and ſo poorly confirm the main and eſſential nature of it, eſpecially when God ſpeaking of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, ſtiles Circumciſion the ſeal of the righteouſneſs of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. But of this more in another Chapter.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The diſtinction of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed into fleſhly and ſpiritual, into natural and believing, conſidered; whether the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of believers may not be called in the New Teſtament the ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham?</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE next thing which muſt have its place of conſideration, is that queſtion of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, with whom the promiſe was made; and upon this hinge hangs all the main weight on both ſides; and if we make out Infants of believers in the N. T. to be in Covenant, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy would be at end: To make out this, the moſt of the following Chapters are deſigned; only in this we ſhall fall more directly on the queſtion it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that differ from us make many diſtinctions of a fleſhly carnal ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſeed, a believing and a natural ſeed, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions are taken out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7, 8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.23. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.16. and moſt true, if well applyed; but before I come to open the Scriptures, I would premiſe theſe conſiderations concerning <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:169965:13"/>1. That <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiritual ſeed were as much his fleſhly ſeed alſo, <hi>Iſaac</hi> as <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> except Proſelytes and Servants.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Covenant was adminiſtred to all <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> natural and fleſhly Children, as if they had been ſpirituall, and before they knew what faith was, or could actually profeſs <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It's no contradiction in d fferent reſpects, to be a ſeed of the fleſh by natural generation, and a Child under the ſame promiſe made with the Parent; for they both agreed in <hi>Abrahams</hi> caſe; none was a Child of promiſe, but as he came of <hi>Abrahams</hi> fleſh: and as he came from <hi>Abrahams</hi> fleſh, ſo every one had the ſeal of Gods Covenant on his fleſh: Thus a ſpiritual promiſe was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his carnal ſeed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There was no diſtinction of <hi>Abrahams</hi> fleſhly ſeed and his ſpiritual ſeed, in the O. T. but all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the ſame Covenant, until they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated from <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, and proved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be meer carnal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and rejected the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There is a carnal and ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> even under the N. T. as our Oppoſites muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, as well as Infants; ſo are the moſt viſible Profeſſors which they baptize; which may have no grace; and many prove carnal indeed, through the predominancy of their luſts and corruptions.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When there is mention of <hi>Abrahams</hi> carnal ſeed in oppoſition to ſpiritual ſeed, it cannot be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:169965:14"/> meant primarily or ſolely of thoſe that deſcended from <hi>Abrahams</hi> fleſh: for then <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were the carnall ſeed, yea Chriſt himſelf, who as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fleſh came of <hi>Abraham;</hi> it muſt be therefore of thoſe of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed which degenerated, and ſlighted the Covenant of the Goſpel, and theſe were properly the carnal ſeed.</p>
                  <p>Suitable to this is that diſtinction of <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a natural and a ſpiritual Father: For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He was a natural Father to theſe to whom he was a ſpiritual Father, as to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the godly of their poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, All to whom he was a natural Father were under the Covenant, and had the ſeal, until they rejected themſelves; the promiſe took in both relations, as to outward adminiſtration, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4. And if men truly ſtate things you may argue as much againſt <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural ſeed from enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe priviledges, as believers natural ſeed now, and with as much evidence of truth.</p>
                  <p>But let us weigh theſe Scriptures which are brought by our Oppoſites: Firſt, conſider that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8. <hi>They are not all</hi> Iſrael <hi>that are of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe they are the ſeed of</hi> Abraham <hi>are they all Children, but in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be called; that is, they which are the Children of the fleſh, theſe are not the Children of God: but the Children of promiſe are accounted for the ſeed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle in this Chapter doth with a bleeding heart begin the ſad ſtory of the Jews rejection from
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169965:14"/> being a Church, and ſpeaks as one loth to mention it, and therefore brings it in with a paſſionate and hearty Apology, v. 1, 2, 3. he was in heavineſs, he could wiſh himſelf <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, accurſed from Chriſt, for his brethren, his Kinſmen according to the fleſh, that is, for theſe that we call Jews according to the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> But what needed all this trouble to have a carnal generation of men cut of? why doth <hi>Paul Paul</hi> take on ſo heavily?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> In the 4, and 5, v. he tels you, <hi>Who are Iſraelites, to whom pertains the adoption of glory, and the Covenant, and the giving of the Law, and the ſervice of God, and the promiſes, whoſe are the Fathers, of whom as concerning the fleſh Chriſt came:</hi> Here is a Catalogue of high priviledges which belonged to the Jews, which they were to be cut off from, which lay on <hi>Pauls</hi> heart, and was like to ſink him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> Well, might ſome ſay, v. 6. then the promiſe of God is in vain, if they be rejected unto whom the adoption and the promiſes belong.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> The Apoſtle anticipates that Objection, Not as though the Word of God hath taken no effect; no, the promiſe is the ſame, and immutable; <hi>but they are not all</hi> Iſrael <hi>which are of</hi> Iſrael; neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are they all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, &amp;c. This is the very natural coherence of theſe words; let us now uſe our judgements to diſtinguiſh and review the place, and we ſhall find it a weapon whoſe edge is turned againſt theſe that count it their own.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:169965:15"/>1. The Apoſtle is ſadly troubled for his kinſmen after the fleſh, for their rejection; his reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Covenant, and the promiſes made to them, becauſe they were the natural ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> which holds forth that the promiſes and the priviledges of the Covenant were made indefinitely to all the Iſraelites.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it's a moſt ſad thing to be excluded from the outward and general adminiſtration of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Why ſhould <hi>Paul</hi> thus break out in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, for the loſs of outward priviledges, if it were not ſuch a mercy to be under them?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Apoſtle holds forth, that perſons may be under the outward adminiſtrations of the Covenant, and yet not get the efficacy of it; v. 6. <hi>They are not all</hi> Iſrael <hi>that are of</hi> Iſrael; the Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, all that were of him: and yet all were not <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, partakers of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward life and efficacy of the Covenant; the Apoſtle only in theſe verſes endeavours to take off that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that God had broke his Covenant by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the Jews, and ſo diſtinguiſheth of theſe that were meerly of his fleſh, who had the outward adminiſtration, but not the inward fruit, and theſe which were elect in the promiſe, <hi>In</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be called;</hi> the reſt he cals the Children of the fleſh, the former the Children of promiſe, v. 8. and ſo though they were under the outward diſpenſation of the Covenant, yet God was not mutable, nor his promiſe, though he rejected them becauſe of their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:169965:15"/> own degeneration; ſo that the ſum of this place is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Covenant was made in general with <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, to all that came from him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That in the adminiſtration of general and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite promiſes, there is a ſecret diſtinction, and a vein of election carried through the adminiſtration, that takes hold of ſome, not of others.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That none are the Children of promiſe, real Saints, but thoſe that have the true effects of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in their hearts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That all Children of Believers, though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe viſibly belong to them, as to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, yet may not follow their Parents faith, and ſo not be <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here is nothing at all to demonſtrate that Infants, becauſe Children of the fleſh, are not under the promiſe: but rather the contrary; for <hi>in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be called,</hi> ſaith God; now he was a Child of <hi>Abrahams</hi> fleſh, as well as theſe which were caſt off, and yet a Child of promiſe; ſo God makes his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant indefinitely with believers and their ſeed, and yet the efficacy of the Covenant may reach but ſome, an <hi>Iſaac</hi> or a <hi>Jacob,</hi> an elect veſſel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet the other under the outward adminiſtration, until they manifeſt the contrary: But more of this from that, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39.</p>
                  <p>I come now to that other place ſo much urged by them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Now to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his ſeed were the promiſes made; he ſaith not, to ſeeds, as of many,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169965:16"/> but of one, which is Chriſt:</hi> Now by Chriſt here can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant barely Chriſt perſonal: for then no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever ſhould be accounted for the ſeed but only Chriſt; it muſt be meant of Chriſt myſtically or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litically conſidered, as the viſible Head of the Church; if to Chriſt myſticall, then to all the Elect as in him, and ſo to Infants as well as grown perſons, who make up that myſtical body: but thus the promiſe is conveyed under ground as it were, none knows the veins of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus in the Old Teſtament fleſh and fleſh came from <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Covenant adminiſtred to them both by its ſeal, yet one fleſh enjoying the ſpiritual bleſſings, the other rejected.</p>
                  <p>Take the promiſe to be made to Chriſt, the ſeed, as the Head of a viſible Church, then ſtill it ſpeaks for us; for Infants of believers were never caſt out of the viſible Church they were once in; and the promiſe is made now to them with their Parents, as ſhall be hereafter proved at large: but if we look no further back then the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> v. of this Chapter, we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome light to this: It's ſaid in the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> v. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us, &amp;c. that the bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come on the Gentiles through Chriſt: Abrahams</hi> bleſſing what was it, but the promiſes, and the fruits, and priviledges of the promiſe and Covenant made to him and his ſeed? The ſame bleſſing is now come on the Gentiles, but through Chriſt, who took away all obſtructions in the paſſage of the Covenant by his death: Now,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:169965:16"/>1. This bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> was not perſonal, but to him and his ſeed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This very bleſſing is come on Gentile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as on <hi>Abraham:</hi> therefore it muſt come on believers of the Gentiles, and their ſeed alſo: For,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It cannot be called <hi>Abrahams</hi> bleſſing, except it come on the Gentiles according to the ſubſtantial terms of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant: Now this was the abſolute form of <hi>Abrahams</hi> bleſſing, <hi>I will be a God of thee and thy ſeed;</hi> and this very bleſſing is come on the Gentiles through Chriſt, as it came on <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> and therefore it muſt be to believing Gentiles, and their ſeed: elſe it will neither be <hi>Abrahams</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the form, nor fatneſs of it; <hi>Abrahams</hi> bleſſing will deſcend on the Gentiles clipt half off, not like it ſelf: And it muſt needs be a very uncouth ſaying to all judicious ears, to ſay, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> bleſſing is come on the Gentiles by Chriſt, as it was on the Jews by <hi>Abraham,</hi> and exclude half the Subjects at once from any right to it; for ſo you muſt, if you caſt out the ſeed of Gentile believers.</p>
                  <p>And to what end ſhould the Apoſtle ſay The bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not the promiſe or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is come to the Gentiles, but that he intended it to the Gentile believers and their ſeed, as formerly it came to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his? This ſhall be further cleared from <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. in their order.</p>
                  <p>But in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. the Apoſtle (ſay they) deſcribes who are the ſeed; <hi>If you be Chriſt's, then you are</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:169965:17"/> Abrahams <hi>ſeed, and heirs according to promiſe:</hi> So that now no Children born of believing Parents can be the ſeed; for they muſt be Chriſt's, according to that in v. 26. <hi>We are all the Children of God through faith in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In general, not to omit that which <hi>Beza</hi> ſaith on the place, that <hi>Claromontanus</hi> Bible hath the words thus, and as he thinks more right, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>If you be one in Chriſt, then are ye</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed:</hi> This is ſuitable to the former verſe, where he ſaith, <hi>There is neither Iew nor Greek, neither bond nor free, &amp;c. but ye are all one in Chriſt Ieſus; and if ye be all one, then</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed:</hi> From which,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It's clear the Apoſtle is endeavouring to take away all d fference between Jew and Gentile, and to hold forth their unity in Chriſt, where there is no diſtinction as formerly: but now the Gentiles being one in Chriſt, are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, as well as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and believing Jews.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle here hath no intent to ſhew the diſtinction of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed as the ſubject of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward priviledges, and adminiſtrations of Ordinances, but to ſhew that none are ſpiritually and really <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> ſeed, and heirs of promiſe, but ſuch as are Chriſt's, one in him with <hi>Abraham:</hi> For if this ſhould be the diſtinction of ſeed as the ſubject of outward Ordinances, it would be as much againſt profeſſing believers as Infants; for there is a carnal profeſſion as well as a fleſhly generation, the former more abominable.</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:169965:17"/>
                  <p>The Propoſition from this expreſſion, as they draw it, is thus; None but theſe who are Chriſt's are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and none are Chriſt's but reall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and therefore none but they muſt be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſome ſay (though weakly) The ſpiritual ſeed are now the ſubject of Baptiſm, the new Creature, the man in Chriſt, Baptiſm knows no fleſh, with many ſuch like expreſſions from this and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: But let us weigh things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If none but ſuch are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and ſo none but ſuch the ſubject of Baptiſm, then viſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are not the ſubject of Baptiſm; for they may not be Chriſts', or new Creatures, no more then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; hardly one among twenty that are truly in Chriſt among the moſt glorious of them, and ſo not <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. None muſt be baptized at all upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; for who knows who is Chriſt's according to election and ſaving faith?</p>
                  <p>If they ſay We have charitable grounds to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſo of viſible Profeſſors, until we ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, This is nothing to the Queſtion, as it is ſtated, nor as it lies in the text; the text ſaith, <hi>If ye be Chriſt's, then ye are</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed:</hi> You ſay none are in Chriſt but real believers, and you muſt baptize none but a ſpiritual ſeed, and new Creatures, which will require not only a judgement of charity, but infallibility to determine.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:169965:18"/>2. The Apoſtle is here deſcribing what the real ſeed and ſpiritual ſeed are, as having an inward right to Chriſt, and not what the apparent ſeed of <hi>Abrahams</hi> was: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Mark whom he ſpeaks unto; to grown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who were viſible Profeſſors and Believers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He puts them to a trial of themſelves, whether they were Chriſt's or no, after they had made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; for they having legaliz'd, and returned to look after Jewiſh Ordinances and works, he tels them, their Ordinances were nothing, their priviledges nothing, being Jew or Greek, but as they were in Chriſt: The ſame he follows on, Chap. 6.15. <hi>In Chriſt neither circumciſion nor uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion availeth any thing, but a new Creature:</hi> So that the Apoſtle here puts an <hi>[If]</hi> to the profeſſing <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians, If ye be Chriſt's, then are ye</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If you have no more but the judgement of your charity to diſtinguiſh thus of men in Chriſt, real believers, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, then we have the ſame ground of charity to act on Infants of believers: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They may be Chriſts as well as grown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God would have us account them holy, as we ſhall prove from that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Seeing they have been taken into the ſame Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:169965:18"/>4. Seeing Chriſt ſhewed ſo much reſpect to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, when brought to him. To judge a viſible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor to be Chriſt's and <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the purblind eye of my probable judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To judge a believers Infant Chriſt's, I have a general Scripture aſſertion, and the ground of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite promiſe, which is more then all my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures: So that,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Viſible Profeſſors are not the ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> for they may not be Chriſt's; therefore there is no ſpiritual ſeed but theſe that have ſaving faith, which all have not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Infants of believers are as much the ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> as viſible profeſſing believers, and we have as much ground to judge of the one as the other, until they manifeſt the contrary; and our judgement on them may have leſs deceit in it then there is in that we paſs on grown perſons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If you will diſtinguiſh of <hi>Abrahams</hi> fleſhly ſeed and ſpiritual under the Goſpel, you cannot apply it to Infants, but to profeſſing believers; for the Children of believers are not the fleſhly ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> but if there be any ſuch diſtinction, it muſt be between viſible grown Profeſſors, of whom ſome are ſpiritual, and Chriſt's; and others carnal, and born under Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and not Chriſt's.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It's a true rule in Logick, that in every good diviſion, <hi>Partes debent inter ſe opponi,</hi> The Parts ought to be oppoſite: Now to be born from <hi>Abraham</hi> both as a natural and ſpiritual Father, was both
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169965:19"/> common, through the promiſe in the Old Teſtament, and not univerſally oppoſite; and ſo it may be now; an Infant is born of the fleſh of a believer, yet the Covenant makes the believer a ſpiritual Father in ſome reſpects, as well as a natural.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ſeed takes its denomination from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and its tenure; and if the Covenant be made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, and theſe were at firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of his body, and renewed with believers in the N. T. as we ſhall prove in the following Diſcourſe: then Infants of believers are the ſeed now as well as formerly, <hi>Abraham</hi> only being the firſt root and Father.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Viſibility of profeſſion doth no more make a man of the ſpiritual ſeed, and ſo Chriſt's now under the New Teſtament, then the Covenant in its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adminiſtration in the Old, made all the Jews and their Children really new Creatures, and a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſeed; for under the one, and the other, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be carnal.</p>
                  <p>All theſe conſiderations are to ſhew that theſe places of Scripture are miſtaken, and doe not ſhew who is the ſeed as to Ordinances, but who are the ſeed as to election and ſalvation; and that Infants may be as well the ſeed, notwithſtanding all theſe places, as well as viſible Profeſſors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> If any ſay, But we have no warrant to judge of any but by viſible profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Let us judge as God would have us, and we ſhall find as much ground to paſs ſuch a judgement on
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169965:19"/> Infants as them; if God call them holy, we may do ſo, and it will be dangerous then to call them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The promiſe is the ſurer way of judging, ſeeing at beſt we can but judge externally, and with hopes; and it's better to rely on God, and to expect what he will do through his promiſe, at leaſt on ſome, then to truſt my own judgement.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Word owns Infants of believers viſibly, as we own viſible Profeſſors, as the Scriptures fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing will demonſtrate.</p>
                  <p>For the preſent, ſeriouſly view all theſe places to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6.11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.1, 6, 7, 8. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.22. <hi>Eſay</hi> 65.23. with many ſuch places, that hold forth the ſeed to Infants as well in the New Teſtament as in the Old.</p>
                  <p>I end this Chapter with this conſideration, that if you exclude Infants of believers to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, upon this ground becauſe they are not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſeed: then daſh out the name as well of grown Profeſſors to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, who are no more ſo really becauſe of that, then theſe Infants, and we ſhall quit the one with the other, and then there ſhall be found no viſible ſubjects of Baptiſm, either of Infants or grown perſons: for they are both, as to election and inward grace, unknown to us to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed; they were both formerly accounted <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, grown perſons, <hi>and Infants eſpecially by the Covenant;</hi> and now the one is to be accounted
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169965:20"/> 
                     <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, <hi>viz.</hi> grown perſons profeſſing, though they may have no right to the inward grace of the Covenant; and Infants who had firſt right next to <hi>Abraham,</hi> muſt be excluded, though they have never ſo real an intereſt, becauſe they are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and cannot ſpeak for themſelves: But ſo much of this; the next Chapter will ſecond this.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> How any perſon may be ſaid to be in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; the divers conſiderations about it.</head>
                  <p>TO the former let this be added, becauſe it ſeems ſtrange how any can be in Covenant, and yet not partake of ſalvation: In opening of this, the common diſtinctions of all Divines muſt be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that according as there is an internal and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal adminiſtration of the Covenant, ſo there is a two-fold being in the Covenant:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Secundum propoſitum electionis,</hi> According to the purpoſe of election in Gods heart, and his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal decree; ſo only the elect, and theſe which have ſaving faith, are in Covenant: this ſome call, and not improperly, to be intentionally in Covenant, God principally intending the Covenant to them; others
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169965:20"/> call it ſpiritually and ſavingly from the effect.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a being in Covenant <hi>In facie viſibilis Eccleſiae,</hi> In the face, or according to the judgement of a viſible Church, where judgement and charity are mixt together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.2. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.5. with variety of Scripture: And of ſuch there are two ſorts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such as ſtand by their own viſible profeſſion, as all firſt Covenanters doe, ſo all viſible Saints now, and ſo many Proſelytes in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.44, 45. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.5. Or elſe,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As in a Political Moral conſideration, as in the right of another through a free promiſe; as if a Prince give a title of honour, or a piece of land to one and his heirs, they are all intereſted it, yet ſome prove fools, or traitors, and are afterwards incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: It's ſo in this, and was with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed: Now that this diſtinction holds in the New Teſtament, I ſhall thus diſcover to you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If men deny an external, as well as internal being in Covenant, none can adminiſter an external Ordinance, an outward ſign to any; for we muſt go by external rules in theſe actings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Viſible Profeſſors will have the worſt of it; for we muſt adminiſter no Ordinance to theſe which are not internally in Covenant; and we have no proof but their own expreſſions, and our good hopes, and preſent probable judgement to warrant us, and many viſible miſcarriages to contradict our judgements and hopes at ſpecial times.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:169965:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. We ſet a ſeal to a blank to all grown perſons who are baptized, or receive the Lords Supper, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out we know them certainly in the Covenant; and that who knows? for our judgement will no more hinder the ſeal from being a blank to grown Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, then to Infants, without they prove real at laſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The beſt evidence you can have from any, of their being in Covenant, is but viſible expreſſions, ſuppoſitions, and hopes, and probabilities, all which you muſt help out by your own charity, and fallible obſervation; for God hath promiſed no ſeal on my ſpirit for another mans condition; it's a bleſſed mercy if I get the ſeal on my own heart for my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>So that the great Queſtion will be anſwered from this, which Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> and they all urge, That if God made the Covenant with believers, and their ſeed, they muſt all be ſaved, &amp;c. With which I ſhall but thus parly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Doth God make the Covenant of ſalvation with every viſible Profeſſor whom they baptize? or with every viſible Saint? or do they baptize them out of Covenant? Then how come any to fall off, and be damned? or what rule have they to baptize by?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Why ſhould it be thought more hainous to ſet a ſeal on Infants, as in the Covenant, then on theſe Profeſſors which afterwards prove not to be in Covenant?</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:169965:21"/>3. Or do they baptize, becauſe that perſons are in the Covenant? If not, then upon no ſpiritual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; if upon their being in Covenant, then either internally or externally; on the firſt it cannot be abſolutely, but as manifeſted externally; not upon a meer external being in Covenant; for then they may ſet a ſeal to a blank: if upon both together, the one externally demonſtrated by the other, then it is ſtill by the external being in Covenant that we judge with hopes of the other. There is a trick that ſome have got, whereby they think to evade this being in Covenant, as the fundamental ground of Baptiſm, by this diſtinction; That it is not being in Covenant, but being an actual Believer, gives right: <hi>To which I anſwer,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Covenant, take it ſpiritually, is the ground of faith, not faith of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Covenant be the ground of faith (for who can believe without a promiſe?) it may well be the ground of an outward priviledge.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To ſeparate the Covenant from the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of actual priviledges, is almoſt as dangerous as to ſeparate actual faith from the Covenant; for the one gives a right as well as the other.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Infants in the Old Teſtament were thus as really to be eſteemed in the Covenant as actual vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Believers are now; and under the external ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Covenant, as the Proſelytes, who came in to the Jewiſh Church, and were the firſt fruits of the Gentiles.</p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:169965:22"/>
                  <p>For that there is an external adminiſtration of the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or rather of God in Chriſt, even in the New Teſtament, is clear; for that many were baptized who proved hypocrites, and many believed viſibly likewiſe, as <hi>Simon Magus, Hymenaeus, Alexander, Philetus, &amp;c.</hi> many in all the Churches: and yet theſe muſt be accounted the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſeed, though moſt wicked, becauſe they can profeſs their own preſent ſudden faith: and poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of believers muſt be accounted the carnal ſeed, though ſo long under a Goſpel promiſe; of which you ſhall not want proof hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Now that all which are baptized, or have any Ordinance, have it adminiſtred fundamentally on the ground of the Covenant externally adminiſtred, I prove thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God adminiſters all his graces by Covenant, much more outward Ordinances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Souls can have no challenge, or intereſt in God, but by ſome Covenant or other; God is tied to none, but as he ties himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If there were not a viſible and external admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Covenant, none ſhould know of the inviſible deſign of it unto any; all things would be in the dark to us, as to Gods Covenant, in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If this inviſible deſign were not ſecretly carried on in an outward viſible diſpenſation, there could be none condemned by an outward rule; for who can condemn theſe who are intentionally and inviſibly
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:169965:22"/> in Covenant, or for <hi>Re?</hi> And if every one viſibly in Covenant be intentionally and ſpiritually in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it's juſt the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The whole is this; None are in Covenant (ſay they) but real believers, the ſpiritual ſeed, ſo none to be baptized but ſuch: when it comes to appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Ordinance, then none are the ſpiritual ſeed but viſible believers; and theſe viſible believers can be judged by no way but by an external pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to be in Covenant; and Infants are no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible believers, therefore no ſpiritual ſeed; when as the one is as viſible by promiſe, as the other by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>

                  <p>THIS Text I firſt hold forth as fit to diſcover the New Teſtament application of the Covenant of grace, and its continuation to believers and their ſeed, as to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his in the Old Teſtament: It's the firſt Argument uſed after Chriſts Aſcenſion,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169965:23"/> to provoke the Jews to repent, and ſubmit to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ordinances; and the firſt open promulgation of the Covenant both to Jew and Gentile, with the prime priviledges of it; in which is contained the Goſpel-Covenant made with believers and their ſeed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here is (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) the promiſe; which can be no other then the promiſe of remiſſion of ſins, and ſo of ſalvation; ſutable to that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. and repeated at large in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. For it muſt either be a promiſe of temporal things, or ſpiritual; of temporal things it cannot be; for there is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute promiſe of theſe things in the New Teſtament, but as included in, or following ſpiritual mercies, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. Neither is there a ſyllable in this Chapter preſſing men to look after temporal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or engaging them to embrace the Goſpel by any outward emoluments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> The great and only interpretation of this promiſe by theſe that differ, is, that it hath reference to v. 16. and is meant of the promiſe of the holy Ghoſt propheſied of by <hi>Joel, Chap.</hi> 2.28. which was to be poured forth in the latter daies, and now viſibly and eminently begun to be fulfilled at the day of Pentecoſt.</p>
                  <p>To which the Anſwer will be clear and fair, though that be granted; and not at all weaken, but ſtrengthen the former ſenſe: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That promiſe is a ſpiritual promiſe, and more large and comprehenſive of ſpiritual mercies then
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:169965:23"/> any other; the promiſing of the ſpirit is as much as to promiſe all at once, graces, gifts, yea Heaven it ſelf, for all are but the fruits of this promiſe; Chriſt in the Old Teſtament, and the Spirit in the New, contain all the promiſes in an eminency. When Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was to leave the World, and ſpeak all his heart at once, and leave his laſt bleſſing, that ſhould be better then his bodily preſence among them, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes all in this, that he would ſend the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16, 26. <hi>Ch.</hi> 15.26. 16.7. And of this large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as well according to Chriſt's promiſe before his Aſcenſion, as <hi>Joels</hi> Propheſy, the Apoſtles and Believers received the firſt fruits in this ſolemn day of Chriſts triumph: So that to ſay it's the promiſe of the Spirit, is as much as to ſay it's the promiſe of all ſpiritual things: For this read in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the fruits of Chriſts death, ſaith, <hi>It was that the bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come on the Gentiles through Ieſus Chriſt, that we might receive the promiſe of the Spirit through faith:</hi> The ſame phraſe that is in this 38. <hi>And in the promiſe of the ſpirit, which is to be received by faith, is included juſtification, ſanctification, yea all graces, and it's here joyned with the bleſſing of</hi> Abraham: But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If they take the promiſe of the Spirit in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and reſtrictive ſenſe, for the external gifts, as the moſt do, for the gifts of tongues, and miracles, and propheſy, they both clip the promiſe, and make the argument and comfort from it invalid, and of no efficacy.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:169965:24"/>1. It's a mighty wrong to that famous promiſe of the Spirit, to circumſcribe it in theſe accidental gifts which were eſpecially neceſſary, and almoſt only for that ſeaſon: when it's a promiſe that reacheth all the latter daies, and is ſtill accompliſhing, though all theſe extraordinary gifts are ceaſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This ſtraitned ſenſe is expunged by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the expreſſions of that Propheſy, both in <hi>Joel,</hi> and this in the <hi>Acts, I will pour out of my ſpirit on all fleſh, and on your ſervants and handmaids will I pour out of my ſpirit:</hi> Which ſhews the univerſality and variety of the ſubjects, and bleſſings in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that it ſhall be ſo large and full a mercy, as if there were to be no limitation of its meaſure.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If it were meant meerly of theſe gifts, why then there is no more benefit of that promiſe after the Apoſtles daies, but that Chriſt was out of date, and did expire with that age; whereas it is a promiſe made for all the time of the New Teſtament, which is expreſt by the latter daies, and the laſt daies, up and down the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>A parallel promiſe to this you have in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3. <hi>I will pour water on him that is thirſty, and floods on the dry ground; I will pour my ſpirit on thy ſeed, and my bleſſing on thy off-ſpring:</hi> Now the promiſe of the ſpirit is alwaies appropriated to the New Teſtament daies.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, This cannot be the meaning of this phraſe, if we conſider to whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>to perſons pricked in their hearts, wounded for
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169965:24"/> their ſins in crucifying of Ieſus Chriſt, crying out,</hi> v. 37. <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> Now what comfort could this be to tell them they ſhould have extraordinary gifts? their hearts were bleeding under ſin, their eye was on ſalvation, they ſaw no hopes of it, nor knew the way to obtain it; the Apoſtle bids them <hi>repent and be baptized;</hi> they might have ſaid, What ſhall we be the better? why (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>You ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt; for the promiſe is unto you:</hi> What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? of gifts, of tongues and miracles: What is this to our ſouls? how will this ſave us? might they well object. It would be but a poor comfort to a wounded ſoul for to tell him of a promiſe of gifts, not of ſpiritual grace; and the holy Ghoſt is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Phyſician then to apply ſuch a raw improper plaiſter to a wounded heart, which would hardly heal the skin: this promiſe is brought in as a cordial, to keep them from fainting, and to give them ſpirits to believe, and lay hold on Jeſus Chriſt: And truly no other promiſe but that of free grace, in order to ſalvation, can be imagined to give them comfort in that condition.</p>
                  <p>But to put all out of queſtion, That the promiſe propheſied of in <hi>Joel,</hi> and quoted here, was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſalvation, and the ſame with the Covenant of Grace, Conſult the Original in <hi>Joel,</hi> and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel in this of the <hi>Acts;</hi> in <hi>Joel</hi> 2.27. the Prophet founds all the promiſes that went before, and all that come after, on this, <hi>That he is the Lord their God,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169965:25"/> and none elſe;</hi> which was the very expreſs words in that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham:</hi> And then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, <hi>viz.</hi> in the New Teſtament, to make out this fully, <hi>He will pour out his ſpirit on all fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> v. 32. which is a part of that propheſy, and is quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted again in v. 21. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call on the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved;</hi> one grace put for all; and ſalvation being put at the end of the promiſe, muſt needs be the aim of it. The ſame expreſſion you have again repeated, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13.</p>
                  <p>And in the former v. 38. he exhorts them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>for the remiſſion of ſin;</hi> the exhortation is to a Goſpel duty; the effect and profit of it was to be remiſſion of ſins, and receiving the gift of the holy Ghoſt; and the promiſe muſt needs be anſwerable, by which all is enforced; and it muſt needs have been a mighty low and diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable way of perſwaſion, to put them upon ſuch high things in the former verſe, and to encourage them only by the narration of a promiſe of ſome temporary gifts in the following, when their eye and heart was ſet on remiſſion of ſins, and ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt; and nothing but a promiſe holding forth theſe mercies could have been conſiderable to them.</p>
                  <p>And it's very obſervable, in that verſe he joyns remiſſion of ſins with the gift of the holy Ghoſt; and then adds the promiſe to both, as the ground of one and the other, and comprehending both: And for that expreſſion of <hi>Receiving the gift of the holy
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169965:25"/> Ghoſt,</hi> it may well be noted, that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the free gift;</hi> not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the gifts of the holy ſpirit;</hi> noting the very ſending of the ſpirit as a free gift to beſtow all mercies on them; and ſo reſpecting rather the free and bounteous manner of beſtowing the holy Ghoſt on them, then any limited effects of his reception.</p>
                  <p>By all which it is demonſtrated, that this is no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, common, no temporal promiſe, or of meer gifts, though never ſo extraordinary, but a promiſe of free grace.</p>
                  <p>I only adde this to all the reſt, as undeniable by the principles of theſe that differ; it's a promiſe made not only to theſe Jews, but it's univerſally to the Gentiles, and to all the called of God: but all that are called have not received ſuch gifts of the holy Ghoſt which then were given: but every one that is effectually called doth receive the promiſe of remiſſion of ſins, and the free favour of God, and therefore this promiſe muſt be taken mainly in that ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>But the great difficulty is in the following part of the verſe, and about the intereſt of their Children in this promiſe; and therefore the next work muſt be to make out this, that the Children as well as the Parents are included in this promiſe, as they were in the promiſe made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us conſider to whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks: to the Jews, who were prickt in their hearts; <hi>The promiſe is to you and your Children:</hi> He ſpeaks to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169965:26"/> them after the wonted manner of expreſſion in the Old Teſtament, when ever the promiſe is mentioned; and uſeth their own language in which they were trained up in from their Fathers; <hi>I will be the God of thee and thy ſeed,</hi> Gen. 17. <hi>The promiſe is to you and your Children:</hi> If the Apoſtle had intended to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude their Children from the ſame priviledges they had formerly by the Covenant, he would never have ſpoken in ſuch a known dialect of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and to Jews, who could take it in no other ſenſe but this, that the promiſe ſhall run as formerly, to them and their ſeed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us mind on what ground this is brought in, <hi>viz.</hi> as an argument and ſtrong inducement of them to repent and be baptized, as in the former verſe; <hi>for the promiſe is to you and your ſeed:</hi> He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth them from this to receive the Ordinance of Baptiſm themſelves, for the promiſe was ſtill the ſame to them and their Children; only now they muſt firſt believe and be baptized themſelves, ere their Children could be conſidered in the promiſe: If the Apoſtle had not intended to hold forth to them now believing and being baptized, and their Children, the ſame priviledges they had before as to the promiſe, it would have been the greateſt delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion inſtead of an argument to perſwade them to be baptized on this ground, becauſe the promiſe was to them and their Children; they had been rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by it then enlightned; and ſtumbled by ſuch a propoſition more then informed of a New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adminiſtration.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:169965:26"/>3. Upon what hinge can this Exhortation turn? where is the vertue and ſtrength it hath to move them to be baptized themſelves, but on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that they ſhould not only enjoy bleſſings themſelves, through the promiſe, but their Children with them? The promiſe to them was enough for themſelves to ſubmit to that Ordinance: but the height of the enforcement is from the riches of the promiſe, that it was not only to them, but their Children; they might bleſs themſelves and theirs by ſubmitting to the Goſpel; elſe to put in the name of their Children ſpeaking to the Jews, was but to lay a temptation before them, and rather to puzzle them then encourage them: And doubtleſs the Holy Ghoſt would never in the firſt opening of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and encouraging ſouls to embrace it, uſe ſuch a language and expreſſion that might deceive thoſe he ſpake unto: for what could the Jews imagine or conceive upon ſuch a diſcovery, but that if they themſelves did repent and were baptized, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſhould be the ſame in the N. T. to them and their Children, as it was formerly to <hi>Abraham,</hi> upon his believing and being circumciſed, to him and his ſeed? there being no expreſſion the Jews were ſo accuſtomed to, and more delighted in, then that of the promiſe to them and their Children: And but to mention their Children with the promiſe, if it was not meant to hold forth that they were ſtill in the promiſe, was ſufficient to have deceived them, who were never inſtructed in any other method:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169965:27"/> The great deſign of the Apoſtle was to open the N. T. promiſe, and by that to encourage the poor wounded Jews to repent and be baptized: And that they might have no cloud on their apprehenſions, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, he utters it <hi>in lingua vernacula,</hi> in the phraſe the promiſe was always expreſt in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the intent of the Apoſtle were not to hold forth the ſameneſs and identity of the priviledge of the promiſe to the Jews and Gentiles now believing, as was formerly; he would never have mentioned Children when he mentions Baptiſm, and eſpecially not in the ſame line with the promiſe made to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and with one breath expreſs the promiſe to both, and make that the ſtrength of his argument to put them on the practice of that Ordinance: And doubtleſs it had not been ſo candid a way, nor ſutable to the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, to tell them of their Children, juſt when he tels them of being baptized themſelves; and name them immediatly with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, if the deſign was utterly to exclude them both from the promiſe and Baptiſm.

                     </gap>) <hi>As many as the Lord ſhall call,</hi> is a limitation of the verſe, and no more are under the promiſe; and ſo Children, if God ſhall call them, ſhall alſo enjoy the promiſe.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:169965:27"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> For anſwer to this laſt Objection, which is the ſtrength of their confidence from this place, we muſt conſider theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That in this verſe you have an exact diſtribution of the world into Jew and Gentile, according to the uſual diſtribution in other Scriptures; the Gentiles being uſually called theſe <hi>afar off,</hi> and the promiſe equally diſtributed among; only he adds <hi>(as many as the Lord ſhall call)</hi> to theſe which are afar, as moſt proper in that place: but it can in no ſenſe be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the former part of the verſe, either to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or Children: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He changes the tenſe in both parts of the verſe; in the firſt part unto the Jews, he ſpeaks <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> of the preſent application of the promiſe; <hi>Repent you, and be baptized—for the promiſe is to you and your Children;</hi> even now the promiſe is offered to you; and they were then under the call of God: But when he ſpeaks of the Gentiles, becauſe they were yet afar off, and not at all called, he ſpeaks <hi>de futuro,</hi> as many as God ſhall call, even of them alſo; which is the firſt expreſs hint of the calling of the Gentiles in all the Acts of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How unequal would the diſtribution be of this verſe, not ſutable to the laws of expreſſion among rational men? If <hi>As many as the Lord ſhall call,</hi> ſhould be a limitation to the former part of the verſe,
<pb facs="tcp:169965:28"/> the word, <hi>Children,</hi> muſt needs be redundant and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous; for Jews and Gentiles comprehend all the world. Now Children muſt either be one part of the world, or comprehended under one or both names, or be a diſtinct world by themſelves, neither Jews nor Gentiles: And this muſt needs follow on ſuch a read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words; for the deſign of the Apoſtle is to hold forth the freeneſs of the promiſe to Jew and Gentile, and their Children; to theſe Jews at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to the Gentiles and their Children when God ſhould call the Parents, as he did theſe Jews. Now put Children by themſelves, as a third party, and add <hi>whom the Lord ſhall call,</hi> and you exclude them from being either Jews or Gentiles, and ſo excommunicate them from any hopes of calling, or being ſaved: Now this is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Contrary to that known rule in Logick, That <hi>Omnis bona diſtributio debet eſſe bimembris;</hi> only of two members, and theſe oppoſite one to another; to bring in a third marrs all. So that it is moſt clear, the words muſt be underſtood as they are tranſlated; The promiſe is to you Jews, and your Children at preſent, and to thoſe afarre off alſo, and their Children, when God ſhall <hi>call them;</hi> elſe <hi>calling</hi> can with no ſenſe be applied to any tittle of the former part of the verſe, without you make it monſtrous, and unlike it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's againſt another rule about diſtribution,
<pb facs="tcp:169965:28"/> which is, That <hi>Partes diviſionis ambulent aequali paſſu,</hi> That the parts of a diſtribution ſhould be equally ſet together. Now here will be a mighty inequality, as to the communication of the promiſe; if the words ſhould be taken in their ſenſe, the Jews will have a greater priviledge then the Gentiles, if Children be not equally added to both; the Jews had the promiſe made to them and their Children at preſent; theſe afar off ſhall only have the promiſe to themſelves, but not their Children.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider how comes this word <hi>(your Children)</hi> to be kept in, for what end and uſe, if it were not to ſhew ſome ſpecial priviledge they have with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, when God cals or converts the Parent? what ſtands it for but a ſtone of offence to conſcientious hearts?</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>OBIECTION.</head>
                     <p>All they anſwer to this, is, that the Apoſtle names their Children to comfort their Parents, becauſe they had wiſhed Chriſts blood on their Children, and ſo to give them hopes they might yet be ſaved, if God ſhould call them.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>SOLUTION.</head>
                     <p>To ſee the ſad ſhifts of errour, is wonderful: Can any man imagine, that the Parents could doubt more,
<pb facs="tcp:169965:29"/> or ſo much of their Childrens being accepted and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when God ſhould call them who were innocent, and only under the ſudden raſh curſe of their Parents, when they ſaw that the promiſe was to themſelves, and Chriſt offered pardon to themſelves, who were the actual murtherers of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such a conſideration would rather ſadden them then refreſh them, to mention the calling of their Children: For they might more doubt of that, then of any thing, whether God would call them or no, and be as far to ſeek as ever they were, that they would have but cold comfort upon this account; this was enough to break their hearts if that were in their eye; the old way of conveying the promiſe is cut off, no promiſe but to <hi>called</hi> ones; our poor Children are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, and God knows whether ever they may be called of God: Thus might they reaſon: But when he includes them in the ſame promiſe with Parents, and exhorts the Parents to repent, upon this ground, that the promiſe is to them and their Children; this ſavours like a Goſpel-comforting-exhortation, and could not be but of great efficacy upon their ſpirits.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. What ſtrange myſterious tautologies would be in this one verſe? if that laſt ſentence ſhould refer to all the former <hi>expreſſions,</hi> we muſt read it thus to make out their ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>The promiſe is to you Parents of the Jews, when
<pb facs="tcp:169965:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> God ſhall call you (and they were then under the call) and to your grown Children, when God ſhall call them; and to all which are afar off, when God ſhall call them: Can any man with his underſtanding about him think the Holy Ghoſt ſhould faulter ſo much in common expreſſion of his mind, when there was no need of adding or calling to any part, but to theſe that were afar off, who were never yet under Gods Goſpel call?</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, the word, Children, may and muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Little Ones, Infants, not of adult and grown perſons, for theſe reaſons,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The word here (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) properly ſignifies an off-ſpring, any thing brought forth, though it be but of a day, of a moment old: Thus when a woman is ſaid to be in pain, and to bring forth, this word is uſed, <hi>John</hi> 16.21. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.31. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.57.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It's an indefinite word, and therefore may not be reſtrained to grown Children, except God had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt it in a peculiar phraſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It muſt needs be eſpecially meant of Little Ones, becauſe they are diſtinguiſhed from themſelves, who were men of years. Now when we diſtinguiſh between Men and Children, we ſuppoſe the one adult, the other under age, and not grown up; and it is contrary to all ways of expreſſion to think otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb facs="tcp:169965:30"/>4. It cannot be rationally conjectured otherwiſe becauſe the Apoſtle doth joyn them with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in the ſame promiſe, and not leave them to ſtand by themſelves, as grown perſons muſt.</p>
                     <p>So that all things weighed, this Text of Scripture, if there were no more, holds forth the fameneſs of the promiſe to Believers of the Goſpel, both Jew and Gentile, and their Children, as ever it was to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and his natural ſeed.</p>

From this Text they gather, that the pretence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children could not give them a right to Baptiſm; and if <hi>John</hi> denied <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural ſeed on that account, much more would he the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted Children.</p>
                  <p>That this is no ſuch ominous place againſt Infant-Baptiſm, Conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Who they were he ſpeaks unto, the Phariſees and Sadduces, men at age, and degenerated from <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, perſons that lived on their own works and righteouſneſs; therefore he cals them
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169965:31"/> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>A generation of Vipers;</hi> which was not as they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children, but as they had not walked in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſteps, but were quite degenerated: Thus he did not refuſe them becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> was their Father, or upon that account that <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed had not right to the promiſe; but as only pretending <hi>Abraham</hi> to be their Father, when they walkt contrary to the principles of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is the ſame now as to grown viſible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, who have related their faith to the Church, and ſo are baptized upon that account of faith and repentance; yet if afterwards they grow carnal and apoſtate, and if ſuch ſhould come to receive the Lords Supper, and challenge it becauſe they are baptized, we might ſay the ſame as <hi>Iohn</hi> to the Phariſees and Sadduces; Do not think to ſay that you are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, or that you have had godly Parents; for you are a generation of Vipers, you have cut off your own right by contrary actings in your own perſons; and yet it doth nothing at all impeach the truth of this poſition, That Believers and their Infants are in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and ought to be judged ſo until they manifeſt the contrary; or that if they believed themſelves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, the promiſe ſhould not be unto them and their Children: And that Text holds not no more then this, That when perſons are grown up to years, and come to underſtanding, they muſt then ſtand on their right, and look to make out perſonal qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for new Ordinances.</p>

                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:169965:31"/>3. This was at the firſt inſtitution of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, when Baptiſm was newly adminiſtred: Now new inſtitutions (as before) require grown perſons, and actual viſible believers to be the firſt ſubject of them; they could not baptize their Children firſt; for then the Parents would be neglected; and the bringing in of a new Ordinance requires renewing of ſpecial acts in theſe which partake firſt of it; as if an old Leaſe which is made in the name of a man and his Children, be at ſuch a ſeaſon to be renewed upon ſome certain terms, the man himſelf muſt come, and acknowledge his owning theſe terms, and then it is to him and his, as before: So now in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament God renews the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> adds a new initiating ſeal to it; it was before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd in ſuch a line, which is cut off; it's now of the ſame nature, only every one muſt come in his own perſon firſt, as <hi>Abraham,</hi> and enter his own name, and then the promiſe is to him and his ſeed: Thus it was in the former place, where when the Jews came to be baptized, they were exhorted firſt to repent and be baptized themſelves; then <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is to you and your Children:</hi> So that this we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That no man muſt be baptized, or receive an Ordinance by any fleſhly prerogative; but where there is an entail of a promiſe, there is a ſpiritual ground of adminiſtration.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That no perſon grown up to years of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, hath right to a ſealing Ordinance, but upon his own perſonal qualifications.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. That the exception of ſome perſons, upon the account of their degeneration, and perſonal defects, doth not hinder but the old priviledges of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe may be conveyed to theſe which do really em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Goſpel, and to their ſeed; all theſe are undeniable in themſelves: And this Text reacheth no further then to the excluſion of theſe which had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated themſelves to be only the Children of the fleſh, and not of the promiſe alſo; which is a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration only <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> from their after actings; and teacheth us that theſe that boaſt in outward pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, without looking after perſonal qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and holy frames within, may be as well judged carnal, as Heathens and prophane perſons.</p>

                  <p>THIS place of Scripture, though it ſeems to ſtand by it ſelf, yet hath full correſpondence and harmony with all other places in the N.

As the former did hold forth the promiſe, the Covenant to Believers and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in diſtinction from all the world: ſo doth this leave a character of ſpecial qualifications ſutable to a ſubject of ſuch an Ordinance; and when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and the qualification ſhall meet together, there is enough for to capacitate to any Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle is in this verſe anſwering a ſcruple which might ariſe in the hearts of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> concerning abiding together of married perſons; the one being a Convert, and a Believer; the other, whether man or woman, an Unbeliever; as it was a common caſe in the Apoſtles times, the Husband might be converted, the Wife not; and the Wife converted, and not the Husband; the Word work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the one, not on the other: this begat a doubt in the believing Party, whether he or ſhe might with a good conſcience live together in that ſtate.</p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:169965:33"/>
                  <p>The Apoſtle anſwers it, ver. 12, 13. poſitively, That they ought not to ſeparate, or leave each other, notwithſtanding that the one was an Unbeliever: And he gives in this ver. 14. a ſtrong and peculiar ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which he makes <hi>inſtar omnium;</hi> for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Husband is ſanctified in the believing Wife, &amp;c. <hi>Elſe were your Children unclean, but now they are holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſcope of the Apoſtle here is to hold forth ſome ſpecial Goſpel-priviledge annexed to the <hi>ſtate:</hi> and he frames his argument by no ordinary medium, of the lawfulneſs of the marriage according to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, moral or poſitive rule, but <hi>à majori,</hi> from an eminent advantage they had together in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The unbelieving Husband is ſanctified in, or, to, or by the Wife.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Children in ſuch a ſtate are holy, as if they had been both believers.</p>
                  <p>That the Apoſtle holds out a Goſpel-priviledge, not common to meer unbelievers in their marriage ſtate, is clear;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Apoſtle puts the advantage on the believers ſide, and there fixeth it; the unbelieving Husband is ſanctified in the Wife, as belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and ſo contrarily, the unbelieving Wife in the Husband: So <hi>Beza</hi> affirms, that in two ſpecial Copies he finds the words thus read, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: neither can it hold ſenſe with the former words but as thus read: And if it had not

                  <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle doth uſe higher terms and phraſes in this argument, then is ever uſed in Scripture to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a meer lawfull or common priviledge; as to be ſanctified in the Wife, and the Children to be holy; expreſſions of another dialect then to hold forth a civil, or natural, or legal conjunction; being ſingled out in Scripture, to hold forth the beſt ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and things, in relation to God and his uſe.</p>

Now in a civil ſenſe things that are common are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean; but in a religious ſenſe, what is common is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged unclean: Now <hi>Cornelius</hi> being a Gentile, without the pale of the Jewiſh Church, he cals him common and unclean, as all the Gentiles were before they came under the promiſe: but God anſwered, <hi>What God hath clenſed,</hi> or ſanctified, <hi>call not thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: Cornelius</hi> was not a Baſtard, nor unlawfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; but he was not accounted a fit member, he was without the Church; therefore the Apoſtle cals him common and unclean: Juſt in the ſame phraſe with the Apoſtle here, when he ſaith that Children are not unclean, he muſt needs mean they are not of common uſe, or to be excluded from outward pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Church: But that is not all, but he poſitively ſaith they are <hi>(holy)</hi>

                     </gap>) <hi>Hence,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is meant only the lawful uſe of the Creature, in oppoſition to what is to be refuſed.</hi> It is a wonder, but that God leaves men to blindneſs when they leave truth, how any man of common underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, finding the Word <hi>holy</hi> &amp; <hi>ſanctified,</hi> alwaies uſed in a religious ſenſe, ſhould fly to this place to make an exception. The Apoſtle ſaith firſt, <hi>Every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which God hath made is good in it ſelf; and none to be refuſed:</hi> that is, all may be lawfully uſed without any legal pollution, as formerly: But then he goes higher, ſpeaking of a religious uſe of outward things; <hi>They are ſanctified by the Word and Prayer; they are all good, and lawful in their uſe to every man: but they are only ſanctified by theſe holy means, the Word and Prayer.</hi> And he might have as well ſaid, that the Word and Prayer are not holy means, but only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be uſed; as that the ſanctification which is by
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:169965:35"/> the Word and Prayer, is to make the Creatures only lawful to be uſed. If a wicked man eat his meat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeking a bleſſing on it, or giving thanks, will any one ſay that he hath not a lawful uſe of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? but any man may ſay, it's not ſanctified to him. The Apoſtle in theſe 2. ver. goes on <hi>gradatim,</hi> by degrees, from a lawful uſe to a holy uſe of the Creatures; <hi>All is good, and may be uſed, but they are ſanctified by the Word and Prayer:</hi> thus you ſee the nature of this priviledged place.</p>
                  <p>But the main place Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> alledgeth for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to be uſed for what is barely civil or lawful, is that 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.3, 4, 7. <hi>This is the will of God, your ſanctification, that you abſtain from fornication, and let every one poſſeſs his veſſel in ſanctification and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; for God hath not called us to uncleanneſs, but holineſs. Here uncleanneſs is taken,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and holineſs for chaſtity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer with Mr. <hi>Marſhal,</hi> That cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity among the Heathens is never called ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but among Believers it is, being a part of the new Creation, and one branch and part of their ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification wrought by the Spirit of God. And though Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> ſaith this is but a ſhift, yet he ſhall ſee it demonſtrative, if he obſerve the phraſes in the Text, and the nature of ſanctification; in the 1, &amp; 2. ver. the Apoſtle beſeecheth and exhorteth them <hi>to walk as they had received from him how to walk, and to pleaſe God according to the rules of Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> and he urgeth it in ver. the 3. with this;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:169965:35"/> 
                     <hi>It's the will of God, even your ſanctification, that is, that you ſhould walk in all holineſs, ſutable to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed rules of the Goſpel,</hi> and as one part and expreſſion of holineſs, to abſtain from ſin: And he inſtanceth ſpecially in fornication, which was the common and reigning ſin among the Gentiles: So that if you view the place you ſhall find, That</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He ſpeaks of ſanctification in general, in its full latitude, ver. 3. as ſutable to all the will and mind of God; <hi>This is the will of God, even your ſanctification;</hi> that is, it is Gods command, and Gods delight to ſee you ſanctified: then he brings in abſtinence from fornication (the ſin of the times) as one part of that holineſs God requires: For ſanctification may be conſidered as it lies in vivification, or in mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which for diſtinctions ſake we may call the two parts of ſanctification. Now chaſtity in it ſelf, as in the Heathens and natural men, is not properly a part of ſanctification; ſome other Epithite becomes it better: Would Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> call all the abſtinencies and actings of the Heathens by the name of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and ſpeak like a Chriſtian and a Divine? Would it be proper to ſay in his Pulpit (when he was ſpeaking of the nature of holineſs and chaſtity) ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified <hi>Socrates,</hi> holy <hi>Ariſtides?</hi> And can he think the Apoſtle would expreſs that which is common among Heathens, in ſuch a high Goſpel-dialect as ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is appropriated alwaies in Scripture to God, Angels, Saints, and their higheſt graces and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to things raiſed above common uſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:169965:36"/> to God and his ſervice, but that he meant it according as the whole tenure of Scripture defines holineſs? How much will the phraſe of holineſs and ſanctification be debaſed and made common, if that ſenſe ſhould be admitted, contrary to the Scripture uſe of the Word? But that is a weak caſe that puts men to ſuch extraordinary ſhifts to maintain.</p>
                  <p>But to go on a little further; The ſame word is uſed by the Apoſtle in all his ſalutations, and inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions of his Epiſtles to all the Churches; <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, when applied to grown men, muſt ſignifie viſible and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical holineſs, and muſt be tranſlated Saints: but when applied to Children, it muſt only ſignifie legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy, that they are not Baſtards; when all men know, that <hi>magis &amp; minus non variant ſpeciem;</hi> and the word is of the ſame import in every place of the New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> If any ſhall be ſo critical as Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> is,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169965:36"/> to enquire how they can be ſaid to be holy: what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is here meant, whether inherent, or imputative, or viſible?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, It's a holineſs of ſpecial ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, and his uſe, as a peculiar people: Some call it a federal holineſs, from the ground of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge; others an Eccleſiaſtical, or Church holineſs, from the account and eſteem the Church ought to have of ſuch Children: but the firſt more fully anſwers the largeſt uſe of the word in Scripture. As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are capable of inherent holineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are in Covenant, as we have proved, and ſo have a holy relation on them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are capable of ſeparation to Gods uſe from the womb, and ſo of being holy to God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By the ſame reaſon we account grown men holy, we may account Infants of believers holy; for theſe that make a profeſſion, may have no inward and inherent holineſs; and a bare profeſſion is not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; we only account them holy by a judicious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and we are often deceived, and have cauſe to repent of our judgements: Infants may be inwardly ſanctified, and God hath taken them into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with their Parents, and would have us look on them as ſeparated to himſelf; which is ground e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to build our charity on, as to eſteem them holy, as grown perſons. There is no difference but this in it; That concerning the holineſs of perſons at age, we truſt our own judgements; and in judging
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169965:37"/> of Infants we truſt Gods Word, who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended them under the promiſe with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; there hath been as many deceits in the event, in our judgement of thoſe of riper years, as in that which is acted through a mixture of faith and charity on Infants. And Gods promiſe, though never ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite, is a ſurer ground for hope, then my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable judgement; which is the moſt I can have of the generality of Profeſſors of riper years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> But if any one ſay further, What is this to Baptiſm? here is no mention of it in this place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> It's true, Baptiſm is not mentioned here; but here is mention of a qualified ſubject for Baptiſm, which is all that is contended for: And if the Apoſtle had ſaid they were believers, then theſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion would conclude, here is enough for Baptiſm; but it's all one, in that he cals them holy, which you ſee is more then legitimate; and you may tranſlate it with as much propriety, <hi>Elſe were your Children impure, but now they are Saints;</hi> that is, ſo to be eſteemed through Gods Covenant, as if they had profeſſed their own faith.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, As it would be moſt abſurd to imagine the Apoſtle ſhould uſe a pure religious word to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a common and ordinary priviledge: ſo there would be no conſiderable medium for augmentation in that ſenſe, and no ſuch force in <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>(elſe were, &amp;c.)</hi> which hath force from the ſpecialneſs of the priviledge to their iſſue, not only to be lawfully begotten, as the Children of unbelievers are, when
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169965:37"/> lawfully married: but to be in a peculiar ſtate of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to God, and to be accounted fit members with the believing Parent of the viſible Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And what a poor and cold anſwer, as to comfort, would it be, when the believer was ſcrupled about abiding with his or her unbelieving yoke-fellow, to tell them, Continue together; for your Children ſhall not be Baſtards: but how full of ſtrength and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt it be, if taken in the contrary ſenſe? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with your yoke-fellows, though unbelievers; they are ſanctified to you, and you ſhall notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding bring forth a holy ſeed; a ſeed of God, as the Old Teſtament expreſſion; in Covenant, as if you were both believers: this ſounds like a medium moſt demonſtrative and conſolatory, both for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and comfort: What plainer teſtimonie, or fairer character can be written to ſhew the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of Infants of believers, then to write them holy, and give them the ſame name that is given to Chriſt, and Saints in Heaven and Earth?</p>

                  <p>THAT the Adverſaries of this truth may ſee we want not a harmonie of Scriptures to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm our judgement, the next place to be conſidered of is that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. eſpecially ver. 15, 16, 17. of that Chapter; which if well weighed, will demonſtrate the holineſs and Church-memberſhip of the Children of believing Gentiles, as much as of the Jews Children that deſcended naturally from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſcope of the whole Chapter is to diſcover the breaking off, or caſting away of the Jewiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from being a Church, and the priviledge the Gentiles get by this, &amp; their ingraffing into the ſame root; and the promiſe of the reſtauration of the Jews again, when the fulneſs of the Gentiles ſhould come in; and every one of theſe expreſt with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of notions, and interlined with many cautions concerning Gods actings in this great diſpenſation. Concerning the full explication of this Chapter, Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> have done worthily, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169965:38"/> have with much clearneſs argued for Infants Church-memberſhip from it. I ſhall onely for methods ſake, and your ſatisfaction, open the main and moſt controverted terms in this Chapter concerning this ſubject. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What this breaking off, or caſting away of the Jews imports, and from what they are broken off; from the viſible or inviſible Church, v. 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What is meant by the firſt fruits, and the lump, and the root, and the branches; and how it can be affirmed, that if the root be holy, ſo are the branches, v. 16.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What this ingraffing is, and how the Gentiles are ſaid to be ingraffed, and to be partakers of the fatneſs of the Olive, v. 17. For the firſt, This caſting off, and breaking off, is not from the inviſible, but the viſible Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This will maintain falling away from grace, and pleaſe the Arminians, the great Enemies of the Goſpel of free grace: but this the Apoſtle prevents, ver. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. by anticipation of that Objection, diſtinguiſhing the Elect, and himſelf as one of them, from being caſt off: <hi>I ſay then, hath God caſt away his people whom he foreknew? God forbid. I alſo am an Iſraelite, &amp;c.</hi> If the caſting off meant here was from the inviſible Church, then <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Elect among the Jews were caſt off from that Church; but <hi>God forbid,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> v. 5. there is a remnant at this preſent time according to the election of grace, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> was one; therefore it muſt be from
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169965:39"/> the viſible Church they were broken off: But here the <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Pelagians</hi> agree with theſe that are againſt Infant-baptiſm, as they do in many other opinions. Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> hath nothing to ſay in his <hi>Examen</hi> of Mr. <hi>Marſhals</hi> Sermon, to avoid this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, but only this, pag. 64.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The meaning is not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of ſome of the branches in the inviſible Church; but as when our Saviour Chriſt uſing the ſame ſimilitude, ſaies,</hi> Joh. 15.2. Every branch in me not bearing fruit, he taketh away: <hi>The meaning is, not that any branch in him could be fruitleſs, or taken away; but he calleth that a branch in him, which was ſo in appearance: ſo the Apoſtle ſpeaking of branches broken off, means it not of ſuch as were truly ſo, but ſo in appearance.</hi> Thus far he.</p>
                  <p>Which is a granting of what he denies; for to be a branch in appearance, is only to be a viſible branch; and no branch that is meerly in appearance ſo, and not really, is one of the inviſible Church, nor can ever be ſaid to be broken from it, but only from his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſtate which he hath but (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) v. 15, 16. as a branch in outward priviledges, and ſeeming graces.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The breaking off, &amp;c. it was of the Jewiſh Nation, of the collective body, though not of every individual, and therefore it muſt needs be from the viſible Church; for as a Nation they were a Church, and the whole Nation was caſt away and rejected; now as a Nation they were not all members of the inviſible Church, ver. 7, 8. with ver. 17.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:169965:39"/>3. It's a viſible breaking off, therefore cannot be from the inviſible Church, ver. 3, 4, 5. 17, 18, 19. For as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> well obſerves, <hi>There can be no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible removing from an inviſible term.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It's a breaking off the naturall branches, ſo he cals the Jews: Now the body of the Jewiſh Church were not naturall branches in a ſpiritual ſenſe; for they believed not as <hi>Abraham</hi> did; but only called ſo as they were naturally deſcended from his loyns, and were members of the viſible Church, and firſt partakers of the outward priviledges of the Covenant made with him: Thus the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth of the body of the Jewiſh Nation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. where after he had reckoned up all the priviledges of the Iſraelites in general, ver. 4. <hi>Who are Iſraelites, to whom pertains the adoption and the glory, and the Covenants, &amp;c.</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king way by this to ſhew the ſadneſs of their rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in ver. the 6. to prevent the ſame Objection, the Apoſtle in this Chapter ſaith, <hi>They are not all</hi> Iſrael <hi>which are of</hi> Iſrael; that is, not all ſpiritual, though all natural brances; and theſe priviledges did viſibly belong to all. As for that diſtinction of <hi>Abrahams</hi> being a natural and a ſpiritual Father, it may go for currant until they come to apply it, and then it is moſt vain; for all that came from <hi>Abraham</hi> as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Father, had a title to all theſe priviledges fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, which belonged to the viſible Church until they did degenerate, and caſt themſelves out, as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau, &amp;c.</hi> But of this formerly.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If they were broken off from the inviſible
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169965:40"/> Church, it muſt be either from union with Chriſt, or communion with Chriſt and his Spirit; for this is the true definition of the inviſible Church, that in it ſouls have real union and communion with God in Chriſt through the Spirit: but none of the Jews that were broken off had ſuch a union or communion, and therefore could not be broken off from it: But ſo far they may be ſaid to be broken off from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Church, as by remote conſequence, as they were excluded from all the means of grace, and the Ordinances; which are the uſual waies and methods of God to bring ſouls into communion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us conſider what is meant by the firſt fruits, and the lump, and the root, and the branches: There be many opinions concerning this, eſpecially two muſt be debated; ſome think it Chriſt, as theſe that follow <hi>Origen</hi> and the allegorical Fathers:<note place="margin">Ego aliam ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam radicem neſcio, niſi Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum. <hi>Origen.</hi>
                     </note> But that firſtly and primarily by the firſt fruits, and the lump, and the root, and the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, cannot be meant Chriſt neither perſonally nor myſtically, is moſt clear if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Jeſus Chriſt was not the firſt fruits in regard of the whole lump of the Jewiſh Nation, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer to the firſt ſimilitude.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt cannot be ſaid to be root unto theſe which were caſt away; no branches really in him are cut off, but ſo were they; for that place of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169965:40"/> the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> v. 2. which ſeemeth to ſpeak of ſome branches which are in Chriſt, and yet are taken away for not bearing fruit: it may be better read, and according to the <hi>Syriack,</hi> thus; <hi>Every branch that brings not forth fruit in me, he takes away;</hi> that is, that do bring forth ſome ſeeming fruit, but not as in Chriſt as root and principle.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In ver. 24. the Jews when they ſhall be called, it's ſaid, <hi>They ſhall be graffed into their own Olive:</hi> Now Chriſt is not properly their own Olive, but ſo is <hi>Abraham, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Jews are ſaid (as formerly) to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural branches of this root, but ſo they were not of Chriſt; but Chriſt was a natural branch from that ſtock, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Whoſe are the Fathers; of whom as concerning the fleſh Chriſt came.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> himſelf ingenuouſly confeſſeth this, pag. 67. of his <hi>Examen, That by the root cannot be meant Chriſt;</hi> and gives us the hint of another ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from thoſe expreſſions, v. 24. of ſome bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, wild <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>contrary to nature,</hi> into this Olive; he concludes the root cannot be Chriſt: for Chriſt hath no natural or preternatural branches in him; all are wild ere they be ingraffed into him as a living root: And the other expreſſion, v. 18. of our not bearing the root, but the root us, if we boaſt againſt the Jews, doth evidently demonſtrate, that the root here is not properly meant of Chriſt, though he be the eternal root of all ſpiritual happineſs,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169965:41"/> ſet forth gloriouſly in many other places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                  <p>Others by the root mean the Covenant: But the beſt and moſt genuine ſenſe is to interpret it of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> with whom, and with his ſeed as ſo many branches, the Covenant was made, and by which both the root and the branches were made holy: And this anſwers fully to both the ſimilitudes. For,</p>

It's an alluſion to the Legal rights about the firſt fruits which were to be offered up to God; and by that all the whole maſs, all the fruits that came after were accounted holy: Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> was the firſt fruits of the Jews: he believing firſt, and being in Covenant, all the lump, the whole body of the Jewiſh Nation were taken in to be a Church, and were accounted holy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As a root it anſwers to him from whom all the Jews ſprang up, and from whom they drew all their Church priviledges, as their breath: Thus the Lord by the Prophet in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.1, 2. bids the Jews to <hi>look to the rock out of which they were hewen, and the pit out of which they were digged:</hi> he means it of <hi>Abraham</hi> firſt, as appears by the ſecond verſe; <hi>Look to</hi> Abraham <hi>your Father, and to</hi> Sarah <hi>that bare you; for I called him alone, and bleſſed and increaſed him, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. That this was an uſual and common principle of arguing in Scripture, from the Parent to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; for elſe he had ſpoken in the dark, and had proved <hi>notum per ignotius,</hi> if they could not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally reaſon from it; and if you obſerve, he writes it as an Axiom of the greateſt demonſtration, and never ſtands to prove it further.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:169965:42"/> to derive holineſs to them, when they ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in, and ingraffed to their own Olive; he laies all the weight on the root, being ſtill holy and freſh, though the branches be broken off. And what can you make of this as to argumentation? <hi>If the root be holy,</hi> Ergo <hi>the branches:</hi> and apply it to Perſons, and Parents, but in a moral and imputative conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. There is a holineſs by gratious eſtimation or imputation, which flows from Gods Covenant, or ſome ſpecial priviledge given to ſuch a ſtock, or kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, or Nation; God taking ſuch a family, ſuch a ſtock, and ſeparates it to himſelf for ſome holy uſe, and ſo bleſſeth them: And thus it was with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:169965:42"/> and is moſt common in the Scriptures, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of priviledges among men, where the ſon of a Freeman is free, and the ſon of a Nobleman a Nobleman; and by way of alluſion, (though it doth not hold in all particulars) as in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, Chriſts righteouſneſs is imputed, and we accounted holy by it: So as to ſome ſpecial privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, the root, the Parent being holy, and in the Covenant, his Child hath the advantage of it; not meritoriouſly from the Parents faith, but virtually through Gods gracious promiſe to the Believer and his ſeed. But,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is not by natural generation, for then it ſhould be to all Children; but by grace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; it's Gods good pleaſure thus to derive the priviledge, and out of ſpecial reſpect to the Parents; and to encourage them in their own faith, and ſtrengthen them in their hopes concerning their ſeed: thus did God chooſe out <hi>Abraham</hi> and his family from all the world, and bleſſed him; yet it was not from nature his ſeed were more bleſſed then all the world beſides. But as Dr. <hi>Willet</hi> ſaith well on this place, <hi>The branches are holy becauſe of this holy root; not by an actual and inherent holineſs, but by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of grace grounded on the promiſe of God made to believing Fathers and their ſeed; which is the ſame in the New Teſtament as in the Old;</hi> and in this ſenſe the argument is ſtrong, and enforcing the ſcope of the Apoſtle. So that though the generation be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, the derivation of a Title to Church priviledges,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169965:43"/> and the characteriſtical note of holineſs is given them by grace in the Covenant, which takes in the branches with the root. In no ſenſe beſides can this argument be true, without you make the root Chriſt: which you ſee cannot be meant in this place without great abſurdities.</p>
                  <p>The third and ſpecial term to be opened, is, what this ingraffing is of the Gentiles into the root, and how they are ingraffed? v. 17, 19.</p>
                  <p>For the underſtanding of this, Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> hath laid down a ſure poſition, which neither Mr. <hi>Tombes, who is the moſt learned Adverſary of this Truth,</hi> nor any other hath or can ſhake; and that is, <hi>That the ingraffing in of the Gentiles muſt be ſutable to the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the Jews; as they were broken off, ſo are we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed:</hi> This the Apoſtle clearly proves in every verſe. In v. 17. <hi>Thou being a wild Olive,</hi> ſpeaking of the Gentiles collectively conſidered, wert ingraffed, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <q>Venerit inſitio: fac ramum, ramus adoptet.</q> But the beſt reference is to the former part of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:169965:43"/> verſe, as it ſpeaks of theſe branches which were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off; the believing Gentiles were ingraffed, (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) that is, as <hi>Beza</hi> and the <hi>Syriack</hi> tranſlates it, <hi>pro ipſis,</hi> for them, that is, <hi>in ramorum defractorum locum,</hi> in the room or ſtead of the branches which were broken off; they were taken away, we ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed: Others tranſlate it, <hi>cum illis,</hi> with them, which remained when we were inſerted: but either inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation will become the ſenſe of the place.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſons which flow from this Text con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſubject which we have in hand, may be eaſier ſlighted then anſwered: This poſition being laid down, <hi>We believing Gentiles are ingraffed into</hi> Abrahams <hi>Covenant, in the room of the natural bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which were broken off:</hi> Now,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Jews and their Children were broken off from the Church, their Children being members as well as themſelves: therefore believing Gentiles and their Children are ingraffed in, the ingraffing in is ſutable to the breaking off: they have nibbled about this reaſon; but the beſt of the Adverſaries have never ſaid any thing yet, as to ſatisfie a rational Saint.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some branches were not broken off; for ſo it's implyed in that he ſaith, <hi>If ſome were broken off;</hi> and if they were not broken off, then not their Children; for it was not only a breaking off per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, but of ſucceſſion, and of their poſterity with themſelves: Now if we be ingraffed among theſe, or with theſe that are not broken off, we and our
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:169965:44"/> Children muſt likewiſe be ingraffed in; elſe there will be a ſchiſm between Jew and Gentile, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the priviledges naturally flowing from the ſame root: No man will be ſo bold as to ſay, that the believing Jews were broken off; and if not they, then not their Children which were then Infants, and had not acted unbelief: For either they muſt be broken off for their own ſins, or their Fathers; not for their Fathers, for ſome of them were Believers, and not broken off; not for themſelves, for ſome of them were Infants; therefore ſome Infants were not broken off; for their Fathers continued in the faith; and we believing Gentiles are ingraffed in among them; therefore our Children alſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the latter end, when the Jews ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed in again to their own Olive, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in this Chapter, they and their Children ſhall be taken in, v. 26. <hi>And ſo all</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and our ingraffing in is ſtill ſutable to theirs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Gentiles are ſaid to partake of the root, and the fatneſs of the Olive tree, in the ſame verſe: this (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) ſignifies the full participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fellowſhip in all the priviledges and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of the root, as the Jews had. Now their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge was not perſonal to themſelves, but to their poſterity; and therein lay the fatneſs of that Olive, in the fulneſs and large extent of its priviledge and ſeminal vertue, that it comprehended Parent and Child. So that as the Jews caſting off was not only perſonal, but Politique, that is, of them and theirs;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:169965:44"/> ſo our ingraffing in their room is; and as they had the fatneſs of the root and Olive once, ſo have we: Now we could not be ſaid to be, (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>To have a mutual fellowſhip with the Jews in the root and fatneſs of it,</hi> if we be only perſonally ingraffed, and they and theirs broken off oeconomically; if there be a fellowſhip, it muſt be at leaſt in ſubſtantials: And this was the moſt eminent and ſubſtantial priviledge of the Jews, that they and their poſterity were taken into the ſame Covenant: The Apoſtle opens this further in <hi>Eph</hi> 3.6.</p>
                  <p>And eſpecially, if we remember, that their break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, and our ingraffing, is into the viſible Church, as is formerly proved, and muſt needs be granted; for all that were broken off, were not broken off from election, and the inviſible Church; neither are all the Gentiles which are ingraffed in, elected, and really of the inviſible Church. So that the reſult is this;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is a real ingraffing of the believing Gentiles into the ſame root from which the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Jews were broken off.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This breaking off was from the viſible Church, and its priviledges, not from the inviſible; ſo is the ingraffing of us into the viſible Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As their caſting out was of them and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, ſo is our graffing in of us and our Children; Theſe concluſions flow naturally from the Text; and all other deductions will be but as dregs after the ſpirits are extracted.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:169965:45"/>4. And to adde to the reſt this conſideration, That if the poſterity of the Gentiles be not taken in, as the Jews were, there will be the greateſt inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the communication of the fatneſs of the root that can be imagined; and the Jews may rather boaſt againſt the believing Gentiles, then they againſt them; ſeeing the root conveyed priviledges to them and their poſterity, but only perſonal priviledges to the believing Gentile; to the one a double mercy, to the other only a ſingle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But this great Objection may be made; No Believer is now a root as <hi>Abraham,</hi> he is but only a branch; and therefore it's not to be conceived how it can be argued from this to every Believer, <hi>If the root be holy, ſo are the branches,</hi> as it may be to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> It's granted, every Believer, nor any, cannot properly be called the root, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and in a ſtrict ſenſe: Yet,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are ingraffed into the ſame root, and convey the ſame priviledges to their branches, as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the <hi>twelve Tribes</hi> did to their poſterities, who were not properly nor abſolutely the root, but branches of it; and we all know, that a Slip well inoculated or ingraffed, becomes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a natural branch; and receives as much from the root, as theſe which grew naturally on it: So that it's as ſtrong to argue on the Gentiles ſide after ingraffing; <hi>If the root be holy, ſo are the branches;</hi> as from <hi>Abraham</hi> to the Jews, who were natural
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169965:45"/> branches; As an adopted ſon, him and his have as full a title to the inheritance as a natural ſon.</p>
                  <p>There is only this difference between the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of priviledges of the Jews as natural branches, and the ingraffed Gentiles; That the whole body of the Jews, good and bad, were called branches; now only <hi>Believers of the Gentiles,</hi> who are called by the Goſpel, with their Children, are ingraffed into that root.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though every Believer is not the proper root, but only a branch of that root; yet for being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed, he is naturalized as the Jewiſh branch, and ſo muſt have the ſame priviledge.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There are branches of branches; and the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt branch hath ſome twigs, and ſpreading ſprigs growing from them which are of the ſame conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and do receive of the fatneſs of the root as well as the main branches; and in this ſenſe every branch may be ſaid to be the immediate root of the leſſer twigs: Thus Believers ingraffed into the root, are holy, and their Infants that are branches of the branches immediatly ſprouting forth from them, are holy alſo, and under the ſame conſideration; and the argument holds ſtill for the ingraffed branches, as for the natural.</p>
                  <p>And as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> ſaith well, <hi>The branches of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors are roots of poſterity; being made a holy branch, in reference to their iſſue they become a holy root.</hi> This might be much more enlarged, but that I would not be voluminous; it's enough that Believers are
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169965:46"/> ingraffed with their Children into the ſame root, as is formerly proved.</p>
                  <p>And then the argument holds firm, That theſe that are in the root, muſt partake of the fatneſs of it; and they which are in the Covenant, cannot be denied the priviledges of it.</p>

                  <p>THE great endeavour of theſe who are of the contrary opinion in opening this Chapter, is, To prove that the ingraffing of the Gentiles into the root is by election and ſaving faith, and ſo into the inviſible Church; for they ſee their caſe is in hazard if it ſhould be meant of the viſible Church: And therefore, though enough be ſpoken before to prove what we affirm; yet becauſe Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> hath laid down eight Arguments with ſo much confidence on
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169965:46"/> the other ſide as unanſwerable; I think it not amiſs to beſtow one Chapter in the diſcovery of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſs of his reaſons, that the truth may have a fairer paſſage into your underſtanding without clouds or demurs.</p>
                  <p>His firſt reaſon is, <hi>Apologie p.</hi> 71. <hi>That ingraffing which is by Gods ſole power, it is into the inviſible Church: but ſo is the ingraffing of the Jews,</hi> v. 3. Ergo. <hi>For God is able to graff them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. As to argue from Gods power to his will, is alwaies unſound in Divinity and in Reaſon; God is able, therefore he will: So,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To argue from power to election, is of the ſame nature; for election is ſeldome or never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to Gods power, but to his will or good pleaſure.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To argue from Gods power in general, to the putting of it forth abſolutely in ſuch a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate act, is as ſtrange; God is able to graff them in, <hi>Ergo</hi> it muſt be into the inviſible Church; as if God ſhewed nothing of his power, but in the workings of ſaving grace; eſpecially if we conſider what a power it is, and only from God: But to take the very prejudice the Jews have even from the letter of the Goſpel to bring them but to confeſs Chriſt, after ſo long a darkneſs, as it was in the beginning of the Goſpell: but to make the Gentiles but outwardly own and profeſs the Goſpel, and yet not members
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169965:47"/> of the inviſible Church; to take away the very groſſneſs of naturall darkneſs and ignorance, is a work of mighty power; And to an outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, where perſons have been long under the power of darkneſs, there needs the ſole power of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Apoſtle may well put in rather Gods power then his will, when he ſpeaks of the ingraffing in of the Jews; for it will require an act of power to gather them but viſibly once again, and bring them into one entire body to make a viſible Church, when they are ſo ſcattered up and down all Nations; and at ſuch a diſtance one from another, that it is as the gathering of the bones of dead men; and ſo it's likened to the reſurrection from the dead, v. 15. So that we need go no further to enquire why their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffing ſhould be attributed to Gods power, ſeeing there is need enough of a Divine power but to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them together from the four winds, to make a collective body, and ſo to be a viſible Church.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, when the Apoſtle ſpeaks of power in working of ſaving faith, he doth put other Epithites to ſet it forth; and not only barely ſpeaks of power which God puts forth in all acts, but exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of power, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.21, 22.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. His ſecond Argument is <hi>That ingraffing, which is called reconciliation, oppoſite to caſting away, that is by election and giving faith: but ſo is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffing called</hi> v. 15.</p>

                     <hi>Sol.</hi> If he means reconciliation in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, as it denotes pardon of ſins, and being made friends with God by Chriſts atonement and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip; which muſt be his ſenſe if he ſpeak like himſelf: Then many abſurdities may follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Jews and their rejection was the ground of the Gentiles reconciliation unto God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That no reconciliation was obtained for the Gentiles before the Jews were broken off.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. As there is external and eternal ſalvation ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. ſo there may be an outward and inward reconciliation; the Gentiles were caſt out from the viſible Church for ſo many hundreds of years, without any hope or promiſe, <hi>And ſtrangers to the Commonwealth of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.11, 12. and ſo viſibly caſt off; and it was a great reconciliation but to break down the middle wall of partition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Jew and Gentile, as to viſible priviledges and Ordinances: And ſo by the reconciling the world may be more properly meant the bringing them in under the means of the Goſpel, and the outward diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Church; which is Gods common way and method of ſalvation; and which to ſome is real and effectual unto inward grace, unto others only to outward priviledges.</p>
                  <p>And the very phraſe, <hi>the reconciliation of the world,</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:169965:48"/> to Orthodox ears, deafens and daſheth the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation; for the body of the Gentile-world (which he means) are not ſo reconciled as by electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſaving grace, though the ſound of the Goſpel hath gone through all the world.</p>

                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the ingraffing muſt be meant of that act whereby the branch ſtands in the tree as a branch: but that is by giving of faith. The minor is proved alſo,</hi> v. 20. <hi>they were broken off by unbelief, and we ſtand by faith, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> It's true, the ingraffing is by faith, as their breaking off was by unbelief: but as their unbelief was ſhewn in a publique rejection of the Goſpel, and by it they and their Children were broken off; ſo the Gentiles are ingraffed in by publique profeſſion of faith, and acceptation of the Goſpel for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Children; and this muſt needs be the Apoſtles meaning: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Ver. 18. He bids the Gentiles not to boaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the branches that were broken off. Now how could they boaſt againſt them but for viſible privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges? inviſible, are out of cognizance to others: Do Saints boaſt againſt one another for election and reprobation? theſe ſecrets of the Almighty: This Argument Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> urgeth with much advantage, in his Book.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In v. 19. he explains further what the nature of their boaſting might be; thou wilt ſay, The branches
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169965:48"/> were broken off, that I might be ingraffed: now can any man conceive they ſhould boaſt becauſe the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the Jews were broken from election and true faith, that they might be graffed in by a new act of Gods election, and by true and ſaving faith? So in ver. 20, 21, 22, 23. he exhorts the Gentiles <hi>to look to their ſtanding, and to take heed leſt they be broken off alſo; For if God ſpared not the natural branches, &amp;c. much leſs will he ſpare thee:</hi> What, are they exhorted to look leaſt they be cut off from Gods election, &amp;c? Will Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> turn a downright <hi>Arminian,</hi> that he may have any plea againſt the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing of poor Infants?</p>
                  <p>There is a twofold way of ingraffing, either by ſpiritual implantation into Chriſt, or by viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith; and both theſe ſhould meet in one perſon, though they may alſo be ſeparated; a viſible Profeſſor may not have ſaving faith within, <hi>yet may have:</hi> So here, the ingraffing in is into the viſible Church by viſible profeſſion; among which ſome are, ſome are not inviſible members: but the very <hi>terminus</hi> of ingraffing is not into the inviſible, but the viſible Church; for neither the Apoſtle, nor an Angel could tell who were ingraffed into the inviſible Church, nor who broken off, but only from the viſible Church, firſt as the proper term, and then by conſequence from the inviſible; for from this Church none were abſolutely broken off that ever were in, and into it few ingraffed.</p>
                  <p>So that if the ingraffing be viſible, the term muſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169965:49"/> be viſible alſo: but the ingraffing is viſible, <hi>Ergo</hi> the term is ſo: This is according to Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his own form of argumentation, from the term to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaffing; the major is proved before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob. Fourthly, That ingraffing is meant</hi> v. 17. <hi>whereby the wild Olive is co-partaker of the root and fatneſs of the Olive; but ſuch is only election and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith;</hi> be proves the minor, by diſtinguiſhing who the root is, which he well affirms to be <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> To which there needs no other Anſwer then what Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> hath given him; <hi>If the root be</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>and the ingraffing in be only by election, and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſaving graces</hi> (which he means by <hi>the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Olive) then it muſt be that we are all elect in</hi> Abraham <hi>as a common root;</hi> Abraham <hi>may ſay, Without me you can do nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> only anſwers by confeſſion, <hi>That it would follow if he made</hi> Abraham <hi>a root as Chriſt, communicating ſaving faith: But I make</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>a root as the Father of Believers, not by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting faith, but as an exemplary cauſe.</hi> How poor an evaſion is this of ſo confident a man in his opinion, I ſubmit to judgement.</p>
                  <p>Let him mind his Argument, and the force of it; <hi>That ingraffing is meant whereby the wild Olive is partaker of the fatneſs of the root: but that is only election and ſaving grace, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:169965:49"/>1. Were not the natural branches which were broken off partakers of the fatneſs of the root? and were they all elected and partakers of ſaving graces or outward priviledges only? and why then ſhould it be thought abſurd for the Gentiles by ingraffing to partake of the fatneſs of the root only in outward priviledges, ſeeing it was ſo with the natural bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and they all grow on the ſame root?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The old abſurdity will ariſe ſtill from this, <hi>That Saints may fall away from election and ſaving grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. How can he imagine <hi>Abraham</hi> to be the root, and the fatneſs of the root to be election and ſaving graces, and that engraffing the way of being co-partakers with the root, and yet deny Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Argument, <hi>That we are elected in</hi> Abraham?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It's improper to call a root an exemplary cauſe; there is no harmonie between them; an example conveyes nothing; here is a conveyance of fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How unſutable to good language is it to ſay, That ſuch are partakers of the fatneſs or fulneſs of an example? can we think the Apoſtle would ſo far over-reach?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Were the Jews partakers of the fatneſs of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> in the Covenant, meerly as from an Exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cauſe? had not they it from him as a natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, God making the Covenant with him and his ſeed? and do not ingraffed branches afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as natural?</p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:169965:50"/>
                  <p>He only adds, p. 73. <hi>That if it were meant of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward priviledges, it were falſe; for the Gentiles were not partakers of the outward priviledges of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol. Abraham</hi> is a root in the New Teſtament as well as in the Old, and ſtill ſtands by virtue of the Covenant to Believers and their Children: And though Old Teſtament Ordinances were taken away with the Jews, and that Church ſtate, yet the root is not taken away; but the New Teſtament priviledges grow on the ſame root; and our ingraffing in gives us to be partakers of the fatneſs of them, as well as it gave to the Jews the participation of former priviledges until they were broken off.</p>
                  <p>All the reſt of his Arguments are much of the ſame nature; only a touch further of each of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 5. From v. 25. <hi>If the breaking off the Jews be by blinding, then the ingraffing is by giving faith; but the former is true, ſo the latter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> This is the ſame in effect with the third Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: Yet,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is not the ſame reaſon, ſeeing he takes it of giving ſaving faith; their blinding was judicial, a puniſhment for their unbelieving, rejecting of the Goſpel, though they had not ſaving faith to embrace the Goſpel; the giving of ſaving faith is not on ſuch terms; neither is ſaving faith ſo abſolutely
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169965:50"/> antecedent to make a man a member of the viſible Church, as blinding is to Gods final rejection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Blindneſs came but in part on <hi>Iſrael;</hi> it fell only on the meer viſible members, not the inviſible and elect: therefore, the ingraffing muſt be only of viſible members into the viſible Church, v. 7. The election hath obtained it, but the reſt were blinded.</p>
                  <p>Arg. 6. <hi>If re-ingraffing of the Jews produceth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is by turning them from their iniquity, &amp;c. then it is to the inviſible Church: but ſo it is,</hi> V. 26, 27. Ergo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> To which I give this fair Anſwer, That doubtleſs according to thoſe promiſes, when the Jews ſhall be called in to be a viſible Church again, there ſhall be abundance of more glory be brought in with them, then ever yet the world ſaw; and the new Heavens and the new Earth, the coming down of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and all thoſe glorious things are fitted to fall in with that time. And from theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions many do interpret v. 26. literally, <hi>And ſo ſhall all</hi> Iſrael <hi>be ſaved.</hi> But yet,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They ſhall be ingraffed in as a viſible Church; elſe <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Fathers would never be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as roots.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They ſhall be ingraffed in as they were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off: now they were broken off as a viſible Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:169965:51"/>3. All that can be gathered is this, That the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſalvation, and the virtues of the promiſes, ſhall more fully and univerſally take effect on the Jews, even to the ſalvation of all of them; and ſo the inviſible and viſible Church be more pure, <hi>and as one in the earth:</hi> but this fulneſs ſhall be to them as a viſible Church, and on the earth.</p>
                  <p>Arg. 7. <hi>If the re-ingraffing be by virtue of Gods election and love, then it is to the inviſible Church: but the former is true,</hi> v. 28. Ergo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. It's ſaid, That as touching election, the Jews are beloved for their Fathers ſake; hence it follows, God hath a love of election to Believers, and their natural ſeed; for ſo the Jews were the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's granted that the calling of the Jews ſhall be according to Gods election and firſt love; and that Gods election ſhall more fully take hold of the Jews at their re-calling, then of any Nation: but yet ſtill the Argument is of no force to prove that their re-ingraffing, and ſo ours, is only or firſtly into the inviſible Church; for they are elected as well to be a viſible Church, as to be partakers of inward graces; and their re-ingraffing muſt be ſpecially and firſtly into the viſible Church from which they were broken off, or elſe there will be no correſpondence between their rejection and re-ingraffing.</p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:169965:51"/>
                  <p>The laſt and weakeſt Argument is this; <hi>If the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffing of Jews and Gentiles be the fruit of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the breaking off by ſhutting up in unbelief; then it is into the inviſible Church by election, &amp;c. but ſo it is.</hi> Ergo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> You ſee he hath ſpent his ſtock and ſtrength to be ſo low at laſt: This Argument needs no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but by ſhewing you the unſoundneſs of this univerſal propoſition on which the Argument is built. <hi>Whatever is a fruit of Gods mercy, is from election, and ingraffing into the inviſible Church:</hi> Which propoſition is moſt falſe, univerſally conſidered: Are not health, meat and drink, preſervation, all outward pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, fruits of Gods mercy? Is not long-ſuffering to theſe that periſh, and the affording the means of grace and ſalvation, the inſtitution of Ordinances, fruits of Gods mercy? and yet muſt they be given only to elect ones? and do they ingraff to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Church? but <hi>ſatis eſt repetere:</hi> you have ſeen the utmoſt ſtrength of the greateſt Antagoniſt to the Truth we hold out.</p>

If we conſider why the Diſciples ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them, and rebuked theſe that brought them; ſurely it could not be out of any cruelty to Infants, or that the Diſciples had no bowels to Infants, or deſire they might not be happy with their Parents; their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections could not be ſo ſtraitned and bound up in unnaturalneſs: but it muſt be from ſome ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which theſe of the contrary judgement take up, That they were not capable, and were firſt to be taught; That only grown men, and Profeſſors of faith, were fit for Ordinances; and therefore they rebuked or chid them, and forbad them to do ſo any more: As if they had ſaid, What have we to do with Children, as to outward Ordinances? they are not capable, they cannot profeſs their faith; and we muſt have perſons able to hold forth the Goſpel, which muſt be viſible ſubjects of Chriſts Kingdome: Doubtleſs ſome ſuch grounds they muſt needs go on, or elſe they muſt ſhew a ſtrange kind of paſſion againſt Children, moſt unbecoming theſe which had but the rags of natural affection left in them.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169965:54"/> kind of ſorrow as breaks the heart; alſo to ſtomach any thing, and to have the ſpirit raiſed in contempt of an unworthy action or perſon: Thus Chriſt was grieved at them, and he looked with contempt on his Diſciples, as dealing moſt unworthily with poor Infants, in forbidding them to be brought to Chriſt; and therefore he commands them to ſuffer them to bring Infants to him, and not to forbid them. Theſe two words ſhews how vehement Chriſt was, and how much his heart was ſet towards Infants. You find ſometimes that Chriſt gave ſome ſharp words to his Diſciples, and to <hi>Peter</hi> eſpecially; but never to have his ſpirit to riſe in indignation againſt them, as when they would forbid Infants to be brought to him; and that which makes Chriſt ſo earneſt, muſt needs be of great weight; he was never ſo moved when they all forſook him, and <hi>Peter</hi> did forſwear him, as when they denied Infants to come to him.</p>
                  <p>I could wiſh that theſe which with ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and ſcurrilous language forbid Infants to be baptized, might read this place with obſervant ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and at leaſt grow more ſober and leſs violent in their expreſſions concerning poor Infants; doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it's a warning to all Chriſts Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon which Jeſus Chriſt gives, is, <hi>Of ſuch is the Kingdome of God:</hi> The reaſon ſhews what the priviledge was they would exclude Infants from, <hi>viz.</hi> being viſibly judged to belong to the Kingdome of God; and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Of ſuch is the Kingdome of God.</hi> Now take the Kingdome of God
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:169965:54"/> either for Heaven and Glory; or ſecondly, by way of alluſion, for the Church, and the ſtate of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, it will ſerve as a full reaſon: Of ſuch, that is, of Infants, is Gods Kingdome made up, as well as of grown men, and they are as fit ſubjects as you are: But doubtleſs he eſpecially means by <hi>the Kingdome of God,</hi> as well the Kingdome of Grace in a viſible Church, as the Kingdome of Glory; becauſe elſe this could be no reaſon to convince the Diſciples of their errour, for they were againſt the viſible bringing Infants to Chriſt for to get ſome outward ſign of favour to them; and Chriſt tels them, they may be as well brought to Chriſt, and receive a viſible ſign, as grown perſons; for the Kingdom of God is made of ſuch, as of others.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt ſhews their intereſt in one of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt priviledges, <hi>The Kingdome of God,</hi> and that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He ſpeaks it <hi>de praeſenti;</hi> not only reſpecting their future eſtate, what they may be; but that even now the Kingdome of God is of ſuch.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He uſeth this as a common inſtructive principle for the future, never to forbid not only theſe, but ſuch like Infants to be brought to him: For <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Of ſuch is the Kingdome of God,</hi> Chriſt would have them take it as a conſtant principle, That wherever they found ſuch like Infants, they ſhould not reject them, but look on them with Goſpel reſpect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> Theſe that differ have nothing to ſay to this, but That Chriſt means it of ſuch as Children for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:169965:55"/> and meekneſs, and lowlineſs; and therefore in the following verſe he ſaith, <hi>He that ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Kingdome of God as a little Child, ſhall not enter therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> It's true, Chriſt takes an occaſion to exhort them to humility and meekneſs, from the pattern of theſe little ones. But,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt ſhews Infants right to the Kingdome of God, as well as the Diſciples, and grown perſons, who can profeſs their own faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Chriſt had meant only to make an example and reſemblance, he might have taken Sheep, and Doves more properly; for they are more meek and gentle then Children, who are commonly froward and peeviſh.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This croſſeth the end of Chriſts reaſon, which was, That Infants ſhould not be hindred from being brought to Chriſt, <hi>For of ſuch is the Kingdome of God,</hi> Now if he had meant of ſuch as were only like them in ſome qualities, not of themſelves, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all in Chriſts reaſon: And thus muſt the words be rendred on that account; <hi>Suffer Infants to come to me, and do not forbid them; for not of them but of humble perſons that reſemble them, is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</hi> Men will rather make Chriſt ſpeak non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, then loſe their opinions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Can we think Chriſt could be ſo diſpleaſed with his Diſciples for hindring little ones to be brought to him, meetly to ſhew them as reſemblances and patterns to grown men; and adde this reaſon, <hi>For
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:169965:55"/> of ſuch is the Kingdome of God,</hi> when he had examples more fit to that purpoſe, even among the meer ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Creatures? No, Chriſt ſhews the priviledge of ſuch Infants; and checks his Diſciples pride, who would have none but themſelves and grown perſons to be eſteemed as having any viſibie intereſt in the Kingdome of God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Let us view Chriſts carriage and actions to theſe Infants; he did not onely ſhew them as examples, but <hi>took them up in his arms, laid his hands on them, and bleſſed them:</hi> all expreſſions of the moſt ſignal love, and favour, and of great import, if duly conſidered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He took them up in his arms, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; the word ſignifies to embrace with ſpecial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; ſo the French Tranſlation <hi>Embraſſer, Piſcator embrachiare, amplexabunde geſto,</hi> Bud. Chriſt took them up in his arms, and held them forth as Monuments of his love; and doubtleſs to ſhew his Diſciples, that he would have ſome outward ſign and character of peculiar reſpect ſet on them by his Church and Saints: Such a carriage was not out of a natural affection only to theſe that could not pity themſelves, but from a heavenly ſtrain of love which he bore to theſe little ones, as to the higheſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Diſciple; and muſt needs be ſymbolical to his Churches, to take heed how they reject them wholly from any viſibie right to the Kingdome of God: Chriſt was to leave the world ſhortly, but he leaves it as a rule to his Diſciples.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:169965:56"/>2. Chriſt laies his hands on them; which was uſed among the Jews as a form of ſpecial bleſſing, and in the N. T. for eminent ends.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For to cure all ſorts of diſeaſes by a miraculous power, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.40.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For conſecration of any to a Divine work and ſervice; thus Church Officers were ſolemnly ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſts work, as peculiarly fit for it, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.6. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.15. and 5.22. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It was uſed for confirmation after Baptiſm, and as an outward way whereby the holy Ghoſt was conveyed; and this is the moſt common uſe of it in the Acts of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.17, 18, 19, and 19.6. where thoſe that were baptized had the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles hands laid on them, and they received the holy Ghoſt: And to this purpoſe may we apply Chriſts act to theſe Infants, to confirm the promiſe ſolemnly after Baptiſm. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was ever uſed (except to ſick perſons) after Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As it preſuppoſeth Baptiſm to precede, ſo it's an outward ſign of a ſpecial ſignificancy, and holds forth as much as if Chriſt had baptized them; for in that outward rite the holy Ghoſt was conveyed; and by laying on of hands others received the holy Ghoſt, as the former Scriptures expreſs; and why not in this act of Chriſt on them? Take all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances together, and you cannot imagine it to be a complemental act: And if this were as an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſign of their receiving the holy Ghoſt, <hi>What
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:169965:56"/> ſhould hinder water that Infants ſhould not be baptized, ſeeing they have received the holy Ghoſt as well as we?</hi> Acts 10. 47. Chriſt laid his hands on them, <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictas ſcilicet manus in quas à Patre ſuo acceperát omnia bona Coeli &amp; Terrae,</hi> ſaith a learned Divine on this place; <hi>He laid thoſe bleſſed hands on them, in which he had received from the Father all good things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth.</hi> This act ſhews,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſt would have ſome outward viſible ſign of favour ſet on ſuch Infants by Churches: And Impoſition of Hands being one of the choyfeſt, Chriſt uſeth that as moſt proper to ſhew his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That holds forth, That if they be capable of impoſition of hands, they are of an Ordinance of like nature, which eſpecially looks at a ſubject purely paſſive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> If it be Objected, Why did not Chriſt baptize them as well as lay his hands on them, if he meant to hint out their right to Baptiſm?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> It's eaſily anſwered, That Chriſt baptized none at all; but he did that which was an Ordinance uſually in thoſe Primitive times adminiſtred after Baptiſm, and equal to it, as to its dignity; and ſo far above Baptiſm, as it was more extraordinary in its practice: And ſo we may argue from this to Baptiſm, either incluſively, or <hi>à majori,</hi> from the greater; and I have more from this place to confirm me, that if Chriſt baptized any, he would theſe Infants; ſeeing he ſhews ſo much reſpect to them, more then to an
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169965:57"/> grown perſon; and did to them thoſe acts which were equivalent, if not ſupereminent to them, then any can have againſt it. Let any that differ from us, ſhew anywhere in the Goſpel where Chriſt laid his hands on any but deſperate diſeaſed perſons to ſhew his power, or on Infants to ſhew his love, and confirm their antient priviledges, or upon any perſon in this latter ſenſe unbaptized.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 2. If it be ſaid, This was an extraordinary act of Chriſt, and no ordinary pattern may be drawn from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer; Grant it to be extraordinary, yet it argues more ſtrongly, if Chriſt uſed an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary act to ſhew his affection and love to Infants, much more may the Church ſhew ordinary acts to them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt ſhewed this extraordinary carriage, the more to check and convince his Diſciples for their extraordinary contempt of poor Infants, who would not allow them an ordinary intereſt in viſible pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges. And it's conſiderable, that Impoſition of Hands was not an uſual Ordinance, or adminiſtred by any but Chriſt, before the aſcenſion of Chriſt, and the ſending of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though Chriſts act ſhould be extraordinary, in regard of the imitation of that act by us; yet he grounds it on an ordinary rule and principle; <hi>For of ſuch is the Kingdom of God;</hi> which he laies down as a fundamental rule. And this is the leaſt that can be gathered from it; That if Chriſt on this ground ſet
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169965:57"/> an extraordinary ſign on Infants, becauſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God did viſibly belong to them; we may on the ſame principle ſet an ordinary initiating ſign on them, as viſible members of that glorious ſtate, as well as on grown viſible Profeſſors, who are but probable members, according to the moſt judicious charity; eſpecially if we will think Chriſts judgement in ſuch caſes equal with our own.</p>
                  <p>But leſt all this ſhould be thought but a meer out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act of Chriſts, that carried nothing of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deſign of grace, he bleſſed them after all, as the fulleſt expreſſion of his heart; and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that whatever grace he had ſhould be theirs as others: for ſo the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſignifies, either to ſpeak well of, or to any concerning perſons or things; and thus Chriſt may be thought to ſpeak much of the ſtate and priviledges of theſe Infants; or elſe to bleſs them, by deſiring for them, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating to them all ſorts of mercies, as bleſſings; according to that <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. And what can be more then for Chriſt to take up Infants in his arms, lay his hands on them, as an outward ſign, to conſecrate them to himſelf, and to ſhew their capacity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the holy Ghoſt, and then to bleſs them; which comprehends the communication of all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and good things? And yet we muſt with ſcorn (poor probable Diſciples our ſelves!) deny them a little water; and think it too much to have them named among the loweſt ſort of viſible Saints, when Chriſt owne them publickly, and ſaith, that <hi>of ſuch at
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:169965:58"/> theſe is the Kingdom of God;</hi> and they may have more intereſt in that Kingdom, then theſe that exclude them: but I ſhall rather believe Chriſts teſtimony, then any mans froward opinion: It's only a wonder how Saints, that have felt Chriſts bowels themſelves, and read this Text, can be ſo rigid to Infants of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, to whom Chriſt hath been ſo kind, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary in his carriages; and ſtampt ſuch viſible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of his love on, even in adminiſtration of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſigns. To what end ſhould Chriſt do all this in ſuch a high and peremptory ſtrain of affection, if it were not to teach us charity and reſpect to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, in theſe ordinary adminiſtrations they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of; and to confirm their old ſtate in the Church, by ſuch a new and unwonted carriage; Chriſt abounding to them who were moſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued, and could ſay nothing for themſelves? And how harſh is it to conceive, that Chriſts intent was hereafter to caſt them out of the viſible Church, and from the participation of all outward ſigns of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, when his carriage was thus tranſcendently loving to them; and ſo only to give them a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before death? Let mens conſciences, not gulph'd in prejudice, judge: This Text, if there were no more, will fly in the Conſciences one day of the moſt confident Contemners of Infants, and their Baptiſm.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Wherein is conſidered the method of God in the Old Teſtament, of adminiſtring Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances in Families, and baptizing Houſholds in the New Teſtament; and how far it contributes to Infant-baptiſm.</head>
                  <p>IT'S not a ſlight thing to conſider, how that ever ſince the Fall this hath been an uſual method of God in adminiſtration of the Covenant, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of grace, to make it run through families and houſholds of Believers, as the ſpecial veins: Hence families, as they were the firſt natural ſocieties, ſo they were the firſt Churches; the Covenant and the priviledges of it was among them; from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> it went on thus: And when the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time came to be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly opened, and fairer expounded, God goes on ſtill in the ſame method, makes the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his houſhold; only the family was enlarged, it became a greater houſhold, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the vaſtneſs of the extent of the Covenant; yet ſtill it was diſpenſed as to a family. Now if you come to the New Teſtament, there you ſee God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in the ſame method, as if he had caſt by an
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:169965:60"/> eternal decree this platform: Baptiſm, the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament Ordinance, is adminiſtred according to the ſame deſign to families and houſholds. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Chriſt himſelf ſaith to <hi>Zacheus, Luk.</hi> 19. who was a Gentile, and one of the chief Publicans, upon occaſion of this mans converſion, to open the nature and continuance of the Covenant to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles in the ſame form as it was to <hi>Abraham; This day is ſalvation come to thy houſe, foraſmuch as he alſo is a ſon of</hi> Abraham: Here is the ſame language uſed in adminiſtration of Circumciſion in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the ſame reaſon, <hi>foraſmuch as he alſo</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>is a ſon of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham: What can be drawn from this place more proper then theſe concluſions?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That as ſoon as ever he was converted and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, Chriſt applies the promiſe to his houſe; if there were not ſomething more in it, he would have only ſaid, <hi>Salvation is come to thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's clear that he opens the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> not only to himſelf, but his houſe; and argues from his being a ſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that therefore the Covenant is not only made with him, but with his houſe, that is, his ſeed; it were enough for to call him the ſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to ſay, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is come to himſelf: but to mention his houſe, together with himſelf, and give this as a reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the ſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> is as much as to ſay, the priviledges of the Covenant is the ſame to you and your houſe, as it was to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob, foraſmuch
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:169965:60"/> as he alſo is a ſon of</hi> Abraham, <hi>as well as they.</hi> Now for Chriſt to ſpeak in this dialect, and to tell them of their houſholds, and of favour to them in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Goſpel, and yet at the ſame time exclude their Infants from all outward ſigns of the promiſe, which they ever had in the darkeſt daies of grace, is a ſtrange policy, unſutable to the ſimplicity of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>The only Objection is from the following v. 34. where it is ſaid, <hi>That the Jaylor believed with all his houſe;</hi> and ſo none were baptized but Believers.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, That is not a reſtriction or exception of all that were baptized, but a deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the power the Word had upon all his houſe with himſelf; for he ſaid in the former verſe, that he was baptized, and with his thoſe which were begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him; and in this verſe he ſhews the actual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Word on all his houſe likewiſe: So that the words are an after deſcription of the mighty workings of the Goſpel, not only to himſelf, who was baptized, and ſo his; but on all his houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others, and men of good account, do relate <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <p>However it's very obſervable, That when he ſpeaks of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169965:61"/> the Apoſtles preaching, and their believing, he names his houſe in the largeſt term; v. 32. <hi>They preached the Word to him, and all that were</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>to all that were in his houſe:</hi> But when he ſpeaks of baptizing, he ſaith (that you may be ſure his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were baptized) <hi>that he, and all of him, or all his, were baptized.</hi> Now he doth not ſay, <hi>all that believed, but all</hi> his <hi>were baptized:</hi> though there is no doubt but all that believed were baptized alſo.</p>
                  <p>But if there were no ſuch emphatical expreſſion, as is by the holy Ghoſt in the baptizing of the Jaylors houſe; yet there is enough to make forth an example of Infant-baptiſm from the very notion of baptizing whole houſholds, ſo frequent in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It will be very ſtrange confidence to affirm, that in all theſe houſes there were no Infants, or little Children.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is greater probability, and ſtronger grounds to believe, when he names houſholds, that there were little ones in them, then that there were not.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Eſpecially when the word, <hi>houſe,</hi> in all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages in the world is moſt uſually put for Children of the houſe, who maintain and keep it up; and ſo often in Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.30. and 45.18, 19. <hi>N.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.12, 13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Where whole houſes are baptized, there In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are not excluded, if they be in the houſe; and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169965:62"/> if not excluded, they are included; they cannot be excluded, for they are principal parts of the houſe; and if only <hi>adulti,</hi> or grown perſons ſhould be meant, when Children are named, that would be to exclude Infants from being Children, as well as from being parts of the houſhold.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Abraham</hi> and his houſe were circumciſed, <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children were the principal parts of the houſe; and they were firſt circumciſed, and then his ſervants, and all in his houſhold were circumciſed alſo, being Proſeſſors of the ſame faith; for <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had a godly family: Yet upon a different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; the one by vertue of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant, which was made primarily with him &amp; his Children, with all his family likewiſe; as they profeſt <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, and ſerved <hi>Abrahams</hi> God; and ſo it may be eaſily conceived how whole houſholds were baptized in the New Teſtament; the Children as in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Covenant; the Servants and others by vertue of the ſame profeſſion: And in this ſenſe there will be no ambiguity in the phraſe of baptizing whole houſholds.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That the Apoſtle ſhould borrow an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion always uſed in the Old Teſtament to include Children eſpecially, and make uſe of it in the New to exclude them, would be ſtrange but to conjecture: Now when ever the houſhold is ſpoken of in the Old Teſtament, it always includes Children. This is ſtill more for the baptizing of Infants, then any thing they can ſay againſt it; and compared with all the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:169965:62"/> former Scriptures, may make up a full demonſtration to a judicious conſcience.</p>

                  <p>IT'S well known among theſe that are againſt baptizing of Infants, what weight they put on that Ordinance of Baptiſm, that all other ſeem light in their eyes, and of no account in reſpect of that. When they ſpeak of Circumciſion, they uſually call that a carnal Ordinance, ſealing only carnal and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary things, and only reaching the outward man; the one requiring only the fleſh for its ſubject, the other a ſpiritual man, a new creature, &amp;c. And ſo much do they idolize (for ſo I fear it is among many) Baptiſm, that even faith it ſelf ſeems little without it: But that I may waſh off this paint, and make Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances look like themſelves, let us compare theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances together, and view them in their dignity, and worth, and ſignifications. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:169965:63"/>1. In general for Circumciſion; We all know how much it was prized among the Jews above all other Ordinances, and that it was the laſt that was taken away with the greateſt difficulty; about which the Apoſtles had more ado, then about the taking away all the Ceremonies; whereby we may judge, the Jews did look on it as the great ſeal of all their priviledges; which when that was loſt, all was loſt. Read the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> Chap. 2.3. when he would ſpeak all their outward priviledges at once, he ſaith, <hi>What advantage hath a Jew? what profit of Circumciſion, &amp;c?</hi> So in the <hi>Galatians, Philippians, Epheſians, Coloſſians,</hi> many Chapters are ſpent to take them off from Circumciſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Circumciſion was that Ordinance which was immediatly annexed to the Covenant, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7, 10. therefore called the Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It was an Ordinance inſtituted long before the Legal and Moſaical Ceremonies of an elder date: It was not a type of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but of Chriſt to come in the fleſh of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the heart, which Chriſt was moſt fully to perfect in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>There is only one Gentleman that writ a Book of Baptiſm, printed in the year 1646. will have Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion to be a type of Baptiſm; which cannot be: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Types muſt have ſomething in their outward face to repreſent another thing more eminent and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:169965:63"/> real: Now Circumciſion hath nothing in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to ſet forth Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not ſo handſom to make one outward ſign the antitype of another.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Circumciſion was as holy an Ordinance as Baptiſm in the New Teſtament; for they are both in themſelves outward acts, and no holineſs more in one then in another, but as they have from inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; only Baptiſm is more eaſy to the fleſh then Circumciſion; and yet not more eaſy, if that way of dipping ſhould be the only way of baptizing, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at ſome ſeaſons, and to ſome bodies.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The N. T. gives as large and honourable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Circumciſion as it doth of Baptiſm: thus the Apoſtle cals it in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>The ſeal of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith:</hi> A character ſo reſplendent and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that the Goſpel can give no higher to an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. And as much as he ſaith of Baptiſm in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. that Baptiſm ſaves through the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of a good conſcience, the contrary Opinioniſts are put to hard ſhifts to avoyd the ſtrength of this place; and therefore ſome would evade it thus, ſaying, That the Apoſtle doth not call it a ſeal of the Covenant or Promiſe, but of the righteouſneſs of faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> A miſerable evaſion! as if the righteouſneſs of faith were not included in the Covenant, or there were any righteouſneſs of faith but what comes by the Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo would make a ſeparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the promiſe of righteouſneſs, and the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs promiſed.</p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:169965:64"/>
                  <p>Others would cloath the Text with this diſguiſe, That it ſealed it only to <hi>Abraham,</hi> whereas it was ſo to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and all that were in the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>This is held forth moſt clearly in that verſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Circumciſion was a ſeal of the pure Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, in which righteouſneſs was promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed indefinitely.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That this ſeal was applied to all the ſeed that were but externally and viſibly in Covenant, to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; and the ſame ſign that <hi>Abraham</hi> received upon profeſſion of his faith, his Child received; and therefore he is ſaid to be the Father of Circumciſion, as of Faith, ver. 12.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Doctor <hi>Willet</hi> from this place holds forth the ſameneſs of the ſubſtance of the Sacraments of the Old and New Teſtament, both which do ſeal the righteouſneſs of faith; and lays it as a great errour on the Romaniſts, who affirm, That the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Sacraments did not exhibite the graces of the New.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This cannot be denied from the place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out men will wilfully put out their own eyes, that Circumciſion had as glorious a uſe as Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſeal the righteouſneſs of faith; which muſt be as well to others that had the true efficacy of the Covenant, as to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf; and no higher mercy can any Ordinance of the New Teſtament ſeal to any.</p>
                  <p>There were many other circumſtantial and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169965:64"/> uſes of circumciſion according to the Jewiſh ſtate, as we will grant Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To engage to the performance of the whole Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2, 3. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To be a partition-wall between Jew and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14.</p>
                  <p>But when the Apoſtle would give circumciſion his true character, and ſhew what the primarie, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall uſe of it was, he calls it a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Circumciſion and baptiſm ſignifie one and the ſame thing, and ſo agree in being ſigns of the ſame grace; compare <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4. and 6. v. circumciſion ſignifies the putting off the bodie of the ſins of the fleſh; baptiſm is into Chriſts death, and to teſtifie the crucifying the old man with him, that the bodie of death might be deſtroyed, as by the comparing theſe two places it is moſt clear, and 3 v. and 6 ver. of <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. chap. onely baptiſm hath this larger conſideration in it, as that it takes in Chriſts reſurrection with it, and alſo the quickning of the ſoul together with him, which was not ſo fully ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in circumciſion, but implied, according as the Apoſtle argues in the ſame place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5. v. for if we have been planted in the likeneſs of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his reſurrection; the one being a conſequence of the other; and as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion did cut off the foreskin in token of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſin, ſo baptiſm by waſhing, ſignifies the taking away the pollution of ſin; thus, God when he
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169965:65"/> would promiſe to kill ſin, and work all grace, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it by circumciſion; <hi>I will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed,</hi> Deut. 30.6. And the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.4. ſaith, <hi>We are of the circumciſion,</hi> that is, we have the true work of grace in us.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why I urge theſe conſiderations, is to hold for the capacitie of Infants, as well for Baptiſm as Circumciſion; there is no reaſon why they ſhould be thought more unfit and incapable for the one then for the other: For</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if Circumciſion were a ſeal of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith, and yet applied to Infants, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm can ſeal no higher mercie, why ſhould it be thought ſuch a ſtrange and unmeet thing to baptize them, more then to circumciſe them? they uſually ſay you put a ſeal to a blank in baptizing Infants; the ſame might be ſaid as to Circumciſion; yet they were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed as well as <hi>Abraham</hi> that profeſt his own Faith. I muſt acknowledge I never could yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand why Infants ſhould be thought fit to have that ſeal applied to them in the Old Teſtament, which the New calls a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of Faith, and yet be denied it in the New Teſtament as incapacious, when Baptiſm can ſeal no more. I wiſh it were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſidered;</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially, Secondly, when Baptiſm ſhall ſignifie the ſame thing in ſubſtance, be both ſigns of the ſame grace; the one cutting away ſin as with a knife, the other waſhing it away with water; and yet Infants capable, and moſt fit to have the adminiſtration of the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:169965:65"/> one ordinance, not of the other; if theſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting judgment, did with more ſobriety weigh ſuch conſiderations as theſe, they would not with ſo much fooliſh contempt write and ſpeak of Infants Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm.</p>
                  <p>A knife may be applied to an Infant, as to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> though old, and in the heighth of his Faith, and ſeal the righteouſneſs of it; but water muſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be poured on actual believers, and grown perſons, ſuch as <hi>Abraham,</hi> but not on Infants, though it hath no more to ſeal; as if there were ſome ſtrange excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie and virtue in the nature of water, that it were too precious to waſh the Infants of believers: For, if there be no more virtue in the water that ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizeth, then in the knife that circumciſed, you ſee there is no more glorious uſe of the one then the other. And what end God ſhould have to put ſuch a Seal on Infants in the Old Teſtament, and exclude them in the New, when the Ordinances both ſignifie the ſame ſubſtantial grace, let any Chriſtian heart imagine.</p>

                  <p>THe ſcope of the Apoſtle in the former verſes is to diſſwade the Chriſtians from Jewiſh cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, eſpecially from Circumciſion; and he doth it eſpecially from the diſcovery of Chriſts fulneſs, and our being compleat in him; that is, you need nothing out of Chriſt now; but they object we want Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; he tells them they are circumciſed in him, 11. v. where the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth of a twofold Circumciſion, one <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, made with hands, the other <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, made without hands, which he calls the Circumciſion of Chriſt, but it is wrought by him, and is by union with him; and you being circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in Chriſt, and have the grace ſignified by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Circumciſion, you need no more; but there be two things they might object;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that this is nothing to the queſtion; you would take us off from outward Circumciſion, by telling us we are inwardly circumciſed, whereas the ſign and the thing ſignified ſhould alwaies go together; <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had this Circumciſion and others, and yet were outwardly circumciſed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they might object we are not ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169965:66"/> in Chriſt as <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed; for, beſides the inward grace, they had an outward ſign and Seal to confirm it to them.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle in the 12 verſe anſwers both at once, they were not onely circumciſed inwardly, with Chriſts Circumciſion, but there was an outward ſign in the New Teſtament to be applied to them, of the ſame conſideration; Buried with him in Baptiſm, &amp;c. This is the ſumme of the words, let us now conſider what may be fairly deducted from them.</p>
                  <p>Many, and the moſt of our Divines, do conclude from hence the ſucceſſion of Baptiſm in the place or room of Circumciſion, that this Ordinance is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the New Teſtament in lieu of the former, and for the ſame ends and purpoſes; which doubtleſs is true from this place, if men would truly weigh the import of the words, and not fight with their own ſhadows.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, this compleatneſs in Chriſt is as well to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Ordinances, and outward priviledges, as inward graces; elſe he would never have mentioned Baptiſm outwardly, when in the former verſe he ſpeaks of inward Circumciſion; he would have kept ſtill in that ſtrain.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, obſerve how he joins them together, and makes them one, the inward circumciſion confirmed by the outward baptiſm, circumciſed with the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of Chriſt, buried with him in baptiſm; now this could not be proper, not of any poſſible connexion, but by putting the outward ſign of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169965:67"/> inſtead of the outward ſign of Circumciſion; that is, you are circumciſed becauſe baptized; you change but the outward element, or inſtrument; but the ſame inward grace is confirmed by both; thus the words are legible, and to be underſtood, without difficultie; but any other interpretation will be found moſt rugged, and unſuitable: For,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as the Apoſtle could not ſay in the former v. that they were circumciſed in Chriſt, but from the analogie between the outward ſign, and the inward grace; that is, if the outward ſign of Circumciſion had not ſignified ſuch an inward work; ſo neither could he have found they were circumciſed in Chriſt, being buried with him in baptiſm, if that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of baptiſm did not as an outward ſign an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that inward Circumciſion, and were in ſtead of that ſign which did directly repreſent it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the nature of the Apoſtles deſign holds out this; for he would take them off the practiſe of Circumciſion; and this he doth by diſcovering of another Ordinance, more ſuitable to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which ſhould ſignifie the ſame thing unto them, in a more large and emphaticall manner, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifying not onely Chriſts death, but his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; ſo that in the very import of the phraſe he cals baptiſm a Goſpel circumciſion; and this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he uſeth as moſt effectual to take them off Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, by ſhewing them they were compleat in Chriſt in the New Teſtament, as to inward graces, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169965:67"/> outward Ordinances, for though they were not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, they had baptiſm to ſupplie the want of it with advantage, ſo that they ſhould not loſe an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, but exchange. <hi>In whom you are circumciſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>buried with him in baptiſm;</hi> if baptiſm did not ſeal and confirm the inward Circumciſion, it could not be ſaid <hi>circumciſed in Chriſt, being buried with him in baptiſm,</hi> and baptiſm could not ſeal inward Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, but as it was of the ſame uſe with outward Circumciſion, which did moſt directly ſignifie the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of the heart; and baptiſm held the ſame analogie, and was inſtituted to the ſame end; therefore it's called the waſhing of regeneration. Suppoſe the Ordinance ſhould again be changed, and the inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould be thus, That baptiſm ſhould be aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and circumciſion ſet up again, and the Apoſtle ſhould expreſs himſelf after the ſame manner; intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take them off the uſe of baptiſm, and to be circumciſed; and ſay ye are compleat in Chriſt, in whom ye are alſo baptized with the baptiſm of Chriſt, being circumciſed with him; would not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction be clear, that circumciſion was ordained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of baptiſm, and to ſupply the defect of that Ordinance? the ſame concluſion muſt be according to the words as from circumciſion to baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme of all is, That as inward circumciſion was ſignified by the outward circumciſion; the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion made without hands, by the circumciſion with hands, as the proper and direct ſign of it; ſo is that inward circumciſion, as really and fully ſignified,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:169965:68"/> and confirmed by baptiſm; and that Ordinance is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to repreſent and ſeal that, as the outward act of circumciſion was formerly: ſo that circumciſion and baptiſm, as to the thing ſignified, and the inward intent of their uſe, are made all one: elſe it will be very hard to make ſenſe of this place of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The Pleas againſt this interpretation are of little worth, if weighed; ſome ſay it's onely meant of the inward circumciſion, and inward baptiſm, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation will ſerve us better then themſelves; for if inward graces, and of the ſame ſubſtantial work be done on us, as circumciſed and baptized in Chriſt, it ſhews the oneneſs of the outward ſigns in the ſame ſignification.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Examen</hi> p. 93. That there is an analogie between circumciſion and baptiſm: yet ſaith it is rather between circumciſion and Chriſts bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, then between circumciſion and baptiſm, as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> and after him <hi>Theophylact</hi> on the place.</p>
                  <p>All which will ſtill make out the truth of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation; For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if there be an analogie between them, as is, and muſt be granted, then there is ſome proportion and agreement between theſe two Ordinances; now it's not in the outward adminiſtration, nor the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſign, in that there is no proportion between a knife and water; and therefore it muſt be in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſignification and reall uſe, which is the Apoſtles ſcope in this place: and therefore he expreſſeth the inward grace properly ſignified by the one Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:169965:68"/> and yet confirmed by the other; <hi>Circumciſed in him, being buried with him in Baptiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the analogy be between Circumciſion and Chriſts burial, not between it and Baptiſm, yet it will come all to one, yea be our advantage: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That ſhews that Circumciſion did hold forth as much as Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts death and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That when we are ſaid to be buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm, and that is the outward ſign to repreſent our burial with Chriſt, we are as if we were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; Circumciſion holds analogy with Chriſts bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, and ſo doth Baptiſm with both: And thus take it in what ſenſe you will, the Text will clear it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>LET us at length come to view that prime Text, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19. on which theſe that are againſt Infant-baptiſm lay the moſt weight. As from the very firſt inſtitution of that Ordinance, Chriſt gives his Apoſtles there Commiſſion to teach and baptize; <hi>Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, Son and holy Ghoſt.</hi> Hence (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) which they tranſlate, Diſciple all Nations, and then baptize them, they argue, None are to be baptized by Chriſts inſtitution, but theſe which are firſt taught, and ſo made Diſciples: But In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are not capable to be taught, or to be made Diſciples. <hi>Ergo,</hi> They may not be baptized.</p>
                  <p>That I may ſhew the errors of this argument, and ſo fully clear up the point, the terms with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion both in the major and minor propoſition muſt be examined from the words of the Text, and that parallel place, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15, 16. which for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods ſake I ſhall hold forth in theſe following con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:169965:69"/>1. For the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, we ſhall not much ſtand on, whether it be tranſlated to make Diſciples, or as it is in our common verſion, <hi>Go teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> for it is ſometimes a verb tranſitive, to teach by writing, or <hi>viva voce,</hi> with a living voyce; and ſo it is to be taken here, ſaith learned <hi>Whitaker De Script.</hi> and moſt agreeable with <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15. where he bids them <hi>Go preach the Goſpel to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſtrength of the argument lies (if there be any ſtrength in it) on the abſolute ſuppoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between diſcipling and being baptized; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſay, None but theſe which are capable of teaching, are capable of Baptiſm; which is <hi>Fallacia à dicto ſecundum quid ad dictum ſimpliciter,</hi> a Fallacy to take that abſolutely which is meant only according to ſome reſpect. But to ſhew the idleneſs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You find preaching or teaching the Goſpel to be ſeparated as to the adminiſtration, and neceſſary and immediate connexion, by <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel;</hi> ſo he ſaith in the former verſes, <hi>He taught many, baptized few.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Compare this with <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15, 16. which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds this, you will find believing and being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized as cloſe connected to ſalvation, as here Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing to Teach; <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Now if any will ſtand on the order of words to prove an inſtitution, we may as well argue
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:169965:70"/> from <hi>Mark,</hi> as they from <hi>Mathew;</hi> None muſt be baptized but theſe which are taught; ſo none that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth and is not baptized can be ſaved; and that Baptiſm is as neceſſary to ſalvation as believing; for in order of phraſe they are abſolutely joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: And what a ſtrange inference would that be to make Baptiſm equal with faith to ſalvation? and yet we have as much ground to argue from the one place ſo, as they from the other; without they will admit ſome other qualifying term to make it up.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The order of things is not always, or commonly ſo exactly expreſt in Scripture by the poſition of the words; for ſometimes one thing in the order of words is put before another, which in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and conſideration is antecedent to it; as <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.15. Repentance is put before Faith. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion with the mouth is put before believing with the heart, as to ſalvation; with abundance of other places of Scripture. Thus many things in the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts are left out by one, ſupplied by another; and the ſame word directly uttered in one, inverted in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, eſpecially about the adminiſtration of the Lords Supper. For to avoyd tediouſneſs, conſult the places your ſelves. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26, 27. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.22, 23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third conſideration to open this Text in <hi>Matthew,</hi> is from comparing it once more with its pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15. there it is, <hi>Go preach the Goſpel;</hi> here it is, <hi>Teach and baptize:</hi> Now hence it follows,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:169965:70"/> that their teaching was by holding forth the Goſpel: As much as if he had ſaid, Open the Covenant, tell men the riches and fulneſs of grace: Now if they muſt teach the Goſpel, they muſt needs inſtruct them in the Covenant, which was to theſe that believed, and their ſeed. Now ſutable to this Commiſſion, <hi>Peter,</hi> when he comes to open the Goſpel to the Jews pricked in their hearts, preſently holds out the promiſe to them and their Children; <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. and by that to make them both Diſciples. So <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. The bleſſings of <hi>Abraham</hi> to come on the Gentiles, is one of the main parts of the Goſpel. Now if they teach men Goſpel, they muſt preach as <hi>Peter</hi> did when he had converted the Parent, <hi>The promiſe is to you and to your Children.</hi> Thus in <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.72. this is made one great end of Chriſts coming, <hi>to perform the mercy promiſed to our Fathers, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his holy Covenant;</hi> ſo that preaching the Goſpel is preaching the Covenant. Now that Infants are in the Covenant as well as grown perſons, we have formerly proved.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This is no more then was required of <hi>Abraham</hi> at the time of Circumciſion, and yet his Infants were not excluded from the Ordinance. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>Walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and be perfect. Chap.</hi> 18.19. <hi>Abraham</hi> was to command his Children, and teach them to keep the ways of the Lord: and yet his Children were not to be kept from the ſign of the Covenant, until they were taught, and had walked before God in upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">

                     </gap> ſignifies <hi>Make Diſciples;</hi> now Children are not capable of being made Diſciples, ſay they.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, 1. Some have been made Diſciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were diſtinctly taught, as the twelve, whom Chriſt called, and they followed him, and became his Diſciples, and were real Diſciples, yet as ignorant as Infants, and were taught afterwards by degrees.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. One is ſaid to be made a Diſciple even in vulgar phraſe, as well who is liſted in the School to be taught, as one that is teaching or already taught, though he hath not learnt a letter: Thus in all Schools it's a uſual phraſe at the firſt entrance of a Child, he is called a new Scholar, or a new Diſciple: Thus Infants being entred into Chriſts School, and given up to be taught in time, and by degrees, may be accounted Diſciples; it was ſo in the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and it's no ſtrange expreſſion in civil Schools.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Infants are expreſly called Diſciples in the New Teſtament, as well as grown and taught men: Thus <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. Circumciſion is called a yoke put on the neck of the <hi>Diſciples,</hi> that is, on Infants, who were the ſpecial Subjects of that Ordinance, and bore the burthen of it, and not properly the Parents; and yet the Parents had the deep ſenſe of it reflecting on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their little ones, and therefore he cals it a yoke that they nor their Fathers were able to bear; eſpecially becauſe it did bind them and their Children
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:169965:71"/> to keep the whole Law; there is no evaſion of this; if they ſay it was meant of the Fathers, and of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Circumciſion, which did bind themſelves: yet they muſt grant the yoke was on their Children as to the act; and that if the doctrine was ſo bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome, much more the practice, which the poor Infants are under; and they are called indefinitely <hi>Diſciples,</hi> either by themſelves, or with their Parents; And the argument is thus: Thoſe were Diſciples on whom the yoke of circumciſion was laid; but on In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants was this yoke laid. <hi>Ergo</hi> Infants are Diſciples in the New Teſtament expreſſion. If you will make any diſtinction, it muſt be in the manner of laying on the yoke, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Parents doctrinally, on the Children actually: but there can be no reſtriction of the word, <hi>Diſciples,</hi> from theſe on whom that yoke was laid, as is expreſt in that Chapter. Conſider,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let us come to the ſubjects to whom the Goſpel is to be preached; and they taught and baptized; it is in <hi>Mathew,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>And the argument our Divines bring from this place is ſtrong and moſt conſiderable: The Goſpel is to be preached to every Creature, all Nations muſt

                  <p>The words hold forth only the general commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given to the Apoſtles after Chriſts death; which was an enlarging of their bounds, who were only formerly circumſcribed in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and charged not to go into the way of the Gentiles: but now the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pale is broken down, they muſt preach the Goſpel to every creature, teach all Nations, and baptize them: but it doth not hold forth either the proper ſubjects of Baptiſm, or the form or manner of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, which ſhould not be delivered (according to their own rule of inſtitutions) in general and indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite terms, as, <hi>Every Creature, all Nations;</hi> and by tranſitive words, as, <hi>Preach the Goſpel to them, teach them.</hi> If this be the prime inſtitution of baptizing,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:169965:72"/> from which place they exclude Infants, when Chriſt uſeth ſuch univerſal and comprehenſive expreſſions; we ſhall deſire but to deal with them on their ground, and the ſame Text will ſerve to prove our poſitions more demonſtratively then theirs: And this Text ſhews, that Chriſt gave commiſſion to the Apoſtles and Miniſters to preach and baptize; but in what order to do it, or what ſhould be required to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of the ſubject as abſolutely neceſſary, is not at all diſcovered in this Scripture; they muſt look for another Text to exclude Infants beſides this, elſe give up their confidence.</p>
                  <p>Either this place is the full and exact rule of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of baptizing, or not; if they ſay it is, then it would deſcribe the perſons, and the manner, the matter and the form of baptizing, and that in the uſual phraſe with other Scriptures: but here is only a general commiſſion to two great acts, <hi>viz.</hi> to preach, teach and baptize; and we may ſay in the ſame place, that whoever are outwardly taught, or do but hear the Goſpel (though they walk never ſo contrary) muſt be baptized; for the commiſſion is, Teach and baptize, nothing of the parties enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of it is mentioned in this <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. nor of the qualification of the ſubject with any diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing character<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If they ſay this doth not hold forth all the inſtitutions in every particular, as they muſt grant, then we may compare other Scriptures with this, to make out the full inſtitution, as theſe where

                  <p>And further, when it is tranſlated to dip, both in the Old and New Teſtament, it ſignifies commonly the leaſt touch or taſt of any thing that is liquid. So <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Dives</hi> begs that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might be ſent (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>But let us view the Scriptures which they bring for the maintainance of this ſignification, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.13.16. <hi>Jeſus after he was baptized, went ſtraight wayes up out of the water,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> ſignifying more properly <hi>ab</hi> then <hi>ex,</hi> from then out; and it is moſt ſuitable to tranſlate it ſo, becauſe all rivers, for moſt part, lie low, and in valleys, in coming to which we are ſayd to deſcend, and coming from to aſcend; thus when Chriſt aſcended, in <hi>Act.</hi> 1.9. <hi>He was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of their ſight,</hi> that is from their ſight.</p>
                  <p>Of the like conſideration is that other place, which they lay ſo much weight on for to hold forth plunging, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.36, 37, 38. Of <hi>Philip</hi> and the Eunuch, it is ſaid they <hi>went both down into the water</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) which may as well, and better be tranſlated, <hi>they went down to or towards the water;</hi> it ſeems they being the upper ground, ſpied water below them, and ſo went down to it to be baptized, as it is a common phraſe among us, to go down to the water ſide.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, ſhould we grant them this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that <hi>they went both down into the water,</hi> which is a ſtraining of the words, yet it can never be proved from this, that their whole body was dipt all over, a man may go into the water, and yet not be over his ſhoes; and how can they prove by this place they went in any further, or how far they went; or whether <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:169965:75"/> did not take up water, and poured it on him; or whether he duckt him under water, or dipt onely his head; nothing can be proved from this place; but if they conjecture one thing, we may another, with as much evidence. In the 107. Pſal. it is ſaid, <hi>They that go down to the ſea in ſhip, ſee thy wonders;</hi> when they go down into the ſea in ſhips, is the ſhip plunged all over? or are they under water in the ſhip?</p>
                  <p>Yet thirdly, it is evident that their going into the water, is diſtinguiſhed in the ſame ver. from the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs being baptized; they went down, or to (or according to their own mind) into the water, and he baptized him: ſo that the going into the water, take it for dipping and ducking, is not baptizing, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſtinct, another act; and if they will prove go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to the water, or into the water, in this place denotes the dipping of the whole body, then he muſt be dipt before he was baptized; for <hi>Philip</hi> baptized him after they went into the water.</p>
                  <p>Again, there is as much from this phraſe to prove <hi>Philip</hi> to be dipt as the Eunuch; and if dipping be baptizing, for the text ſaith expreſly, <hi>they both went down to,</hi> or <hi>in the water,</hi> if you interpret it after their own heart, that they both went into the water, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> was as much in the water as the Eunuch; for there is no exception made, but both went in together, and who ſhould then baptize the Eunuch? if this ſeem to be an abſurdity to them, how can they from this expreſſion, in the ſevereſt acception, conclude the Eunuch was dipt? but they both went into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:169965:76"/> together, ſeeing the Text ſpeaks as much of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> going into the water, as of the Eunuchs: But if we take it according to the firſt tranſlation, that they went both down towards the water, there may be ſome reaſonable account given how the one was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized; which ſeems to be moſt probable, by pouring out water upon him.</p>
                  <p>If any one object further from the next verſe, that they aſcended out of the water, here is not (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> as in the former place, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>out of the water,</hi> yet it will not at all help them; for it is ſaid of them both, they came up out of the water, and it ſpeaks as much of <hi>Philips</hi> dipping himſelf as the Eunuch; and you may as well argue that <hi>Philip</hi> was new dipt, as that the Eunuch was baptized by dipping, becauſe they both came up out of the water; beſides, one may be ſaid very properly to come out of the water, if he put but his foot into it; and thus you ſee on what weak foundations theſe high ſtructures of confidence and rigidneſs are built.</p>
                  <p>The third and moſt triumphant place, which they cry up, and adore for this manner of baptizing by dipping, is <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>And John was baptizing in Aenon near to Salem, becauſe there was much water there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we conſider impartially, here is but a Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall deſcription of this place, of it's ſituation, nigh <hi>Salem,</hi> and of the benefit they had of water, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the moſt places beſides in the countrey, <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> lying nigh the banks of <hi>Jordan;</hi> and whereas they
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169965:76"/> lay the weight on this, that he gives it as a reaſon why <hi>John</hi> was baptizing at <hi>Aenon,</hi> becauſe there was much water there; it may be a very good reaſon why he choſe that place for the countrey to come in, and be baptized, becauſe they might go many a mile in theſe hot countreys, and not meet with a drop of water, and it was a great priviledge accounted to theſe places that banked on <hi>Iordan,</hi> that they had much water; but what argument is to prove that <hi>Iohn</hi> plunged all he baptized?</p>
                  <p>The Argument according to their form muſt be thus. <hi>John</hi> baptized in <hi>Aenon,</hi> becauſe there was much water; <hi>Ergo,</hi> baptizing is by dipping all the whole body; this is a dangerous and ominous way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe who deny conſequences, and deductions, for to warrant duties without expreſs ſyllabical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; I hope they will allow us the ſame priviledge of demonſtration, when we ſay whole houſes were baptized, <hi>Ergo</hi> Infants and Children, who are the pillars of a houſe; is not this more fair and probable, then that <hi>Iohn</hi> plunged their whole body, becauſe there was much water? There is none of our conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences for Infants baptiſm ſo ſtrained and far fetcht, as we have demonſtrated formerly; it was neceſſary for them that had ſo many of ſeveral parts to baptize, to go where there may be much water, when they could get hatdly a drop many miles round about, and yet not immerſe every one they baptized; you may in <hi>England</hi> go 20 miles in ſome countreys, and not find a river to plunge a mans whole body under the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169965:77"/> water, what would it be in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the other hot countreys, where water is ſold as wine and bear with us, how far might they go ere they could get a river to plunge themſelves in? Thus you ſee how little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they have from theſe Scriptures to be ſo perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory and rigid, as to make the eſſence of baptiſm to be dipping, or plunging all the body.</p>
                  <p>The laſt pretence commonly urged for this dipping, is from the analogie it hath with Chriſts burial, from that <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Buried with him in baptiſm;</hi> hence ſay they it is clear one muſt be dipt under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, elſe it will not repreſent a burial. In this they put all their confidence, and therefore let us ſeriouſly view their ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Firſt, let it be conſidered that they ſtill make uſe of conſequences, to prove inſtitutions, which they will not allow us.</p>
                  <p>But more particularly, 1. Plunging the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into the water, doth not hold ſimilitude neither with Chriſts burial, nor the manner of burials in the moſt part of the world; for firſt, for Chriſts burial and the manner of it, was not by throwing under the earth, for Chriſts body was wrapt in a linnen cloth by <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and laid in a Tomb, or Sepulchre, hewen out of a rock, for that was the cuſtome of the Jews, <hi>è rupe ſpecum excavare condendis corporibus:</hi> Matth. 27.60. <hi>To cut out a place like a cave,</hi> or den, <hi>out of a rock to lay their dead bodies in,</hi> as is obſerved by a man of great learning, and diligence; thus when wee ſleep in our houſes we may be ſaid to be buried, having ſomething over our heads.</p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:169965:77"/>
                  <p>Secondly, the manner of burying in <hi>Europe</hi> is not by plunging the bodie into a pit of duſt, but by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duſt or dung on the perſon: ſo that their pouring out water on an Infant as a paſſive ſubject, ſeems more to anſwer the ſimilitude of burying, then the caſting into the water, wherein there is ſome motion of the party himſelf contributing to his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, no man is ſaid to be buried who falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the water, or under earth, without he ſtay there ſome conſiderable time.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we are ſaid to be buried with Chriſt in baptiſm, in regard of the ſpiritual union we have with Chriſt in his death, and burial; and this is as much ſignified by pouring water on a perſon (as earth on a dead body) as well, I ſay, as by plunging.</p>
                  <p>Let us now conſider what remains to be ſaid againſt this abſolute rule, as they would make it; you have ſeen all their main places for plunging, with what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, at the beſt <hi>ex probabilibus &amp; incertis,</hi> out of probable and uncertain conjectures, which they ſo much tax us withall, and yet the eye ſees not it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Let us now go on, and conſider what other places of Scripture ſpeak more direct to qualifie this rigid opinion of plunging.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Iohn</hi> began firſt to adminiſter his office, it is ſaid <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.5. <hi>That Ieruſalem, and all Iudea, and all the regions round about Iordan went forth to</hi> John, <hi>and were baptized of him in Iordan:</hi> A man had need have
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169965:78"/> good ſtore of confidence to perſwade himſelf and others, that all theſe people were baptized by plunging their whole body into <hi>Jordan,</hi> or that they were dipt in their cloaths, or came with any prepared garments for that purpoſe; all which are neceſſary circumſtances to be conſidered; doubtleſſe they were many thouſands that came forth, for the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is from the greater number; all <hi>Iudea</hi> and <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> &amp;c. that is, a very great many, or the greateſt number of theſe Inhabitants; and how they could be thus baptized, men and women, in their cloaths pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly, or how they could get garments ſo ready as to make the act decent, or what places they could have, ſeeing there were ſo many, for the women and the men, to prepare themſelves for the comely admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of ſuch an Ordinance, I cannot imagine; we hear <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized ſo many, but in what manner is uncertain; and that which is ſo hotly contended for moſt improbable, all things duely conſidered.</p>
                  <p>The like is of that, 2 <hi>Acts</hi> 41. where 3000 were baptized in one day by the Apoſtle, which if it were performed by plunging, could not but be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the like inconveniences: ſo that it is only ſaid they were baptized, not how; and the word, as you have ſeen, is not ſo ſtrictly to be appropriated to dipping, but admits of a more large ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, of the ſame conſideration is that place, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12. where it is expreſly ſaid, that men and women were baptized together, and on a ſudden, which can
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:169965:78"/> hardly be conceived how it could be done with that gravity the Goſpel requires, by plunging in their own proper habits; and ſuch ſudden acts could not be done with ſuitable preparations of garments.</p>
                  <p>But to come to particular inſtances, and parallel them together with former places, which are brought to prove this kind of dipping; and let us judge which hath more demonſtration. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.18. <hi>Paul</hi> was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized in the houſe of <hi>Iudas;</hi> there is nothing of a <hi>Iordan</hi> or <hi>Aenon,</hi> a river that he was carried unto; neither can they by any thing prove that <hi>Paul</hi> was thus dipt, but only their good will to have it ſo; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it probable that every houſe had a deep pond belonging to it, or a river running through it, or ſo vaſt a receptacle or ciſtern to hold water as to plunge a mans whole bodie in it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, conſider the Jailors caſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.33. he was baptized in the priſon, and at midnight, he and his houſe; he waſhed their ſtripes, and they waſhed him in token of remiſſion of ſins.</p>
                  <p>All that the moſt rationall and profound Critick of that judgement can ſay, is onely this; That it may be ſuppoſed he had ſome great veſſel, which ſome had in theſe hot countreys for waſhing themſelves in, and ſo made uſe of it himſelf to be baptized; but what a poor ſuppoſition is this? there is nothing either in the text, or from reaſon to countenance it; who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that in theſe hot countreys where water is ſo ſcarce and precious, a poor Jaylor ſhould have ſuch a veſſel of ſo large and vaſt a continent, which muſt
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:169965:79"/> coſt much; or that the State would provide ſuch a veſſel in the Priſon to bathe and refreſh Priſoners who are under ſuſpition, or cenſures of all ſorts of crimes againſt the State? but no more of that; it's too groſs to conceive: And why may not we as well argue thus; The Jaylor was baptized late in the night in the Priſon; <hi>Ergo</hi> not by plunging, but waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or pouring out water on him, as they argue from <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.33. <hi>John</hi> was baptizing in <hi>Aenon</hi> near <hi>Salem,</hi> becauſe there was much water there; <hi>Ergo</hi> he bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by plunging; I leave it to any ſober judgement to determine; if the one prove that baptizing may be by dipping, the other proves it may be by ſome other way.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the Scripture is not ſo peremptory as theſe men are, but hath left the method of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing in general, and under a latitude: Neither can they bring one expreſs place which holds it forth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in precept or preſident (which they call for from us to ſhew them for our judgement, and will not be ſatisfied in all other conſiderations) and have no more but conjectural conſequences to prove their abſolute determinations, but what their confidence ſupplies: And if there be any abſolute need of dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, it is to cool the heat of theſe mens ſpirits, who deny Baptiſm to be true, becauſe they have not been plunged.</p>
                  <p>The ſum of all is this; They affirm the word, <hi>To baptize,</hi> ſignifies only immerſion, plunging or dipping the whole body under water; we deny it, and ſhew
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:169965:79"/> that it ſignifies to waſh by pouring on water, and more often in the Old and New Teſtament; and that when this word is uſed in the Scripture, it's op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to other words that ſignifie properly douſing, or caſting under water: And I think I may ſay it without too much raſhneſs, that they can hardly bring one explicit place in the Old or New Teſtament, where the word, <hi>To baptize,</hi> is uſed poſitively for plunging or douſing under water; and doubtleſs the moſt of that judgement know not what the meaning of the words are, elſe they would not lay the eſſence of Baptiſm on a word of ſuch a large uſe.</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures being thus cleared, to ſpeak at leaſt, that plunging is not abſolutely neceſſary to conſtitute the truth of Baptiſm: Let us now come to conſider the morality of this judgement, and the practical conveniencies or inconveniencies of this way of plunging; for if it be the only and pure Goſpel-way, it will have no ominous or uncomely aſpect on other rules, which are from the ſame authority, nor any way aſperſe the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I know no how to believe that Chriſt would ordain any Ordinance, and tye ſouls ſtrictly to it, that cannot be practiſed univerſally by all, and but in ſome places, and at ſome ſeaſons, without manifold inconveniencies and dangers unto nature: For if only dipping ſhould be baptizing, and every one that believes ought preſently to be baptized, how ſhall they do that live in thoſe hot and dry Countrys where water is ſo ſcarce, as it is in many places of the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169965:80"/> world, who muſt be forced to go ſo many miles to come to a River, and yet may only find it a ſmall Brook, with which they can hardly wet their feet in paſſing over, as it is in many places of the World?</p>
                  <p>And if there were in every place never ſo much water, yet how dangerous is it for ſome bodies who are rheumatick, and ſubject to Catarrhs and defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the winter time (for no ſeaſon ſhould hinder a man from the practice of an Ordinance) in cold and wet to be plunged into the water? it were enough to beget diſeaſes in the moſt healthy bodies; Chriſt is more tender of the bodies of his Saints, then to put them into ſuch hazards; and I hope no one will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Baptiſm to be a charm to prevent all inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies and diſeaſes on the body: yet the zeal of theſe of that way carries on ſo furiouſly, that they think it's impoſſible for them to get any hurt, though they plunge themſelves into the water in froſt and ſnow: but it's dangerous to tempt God out of his ordinary way of preſervation, when there is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity for ſuch a practice. Beſides, this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance would be a greater yoke and burthen then Circumciſion, if this rule of theirs ſhould be ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally followed; for there was no danger to the Child by that act, though it ſeemed bloody and hard: But if all perſons (for none are excluded by any weakneſs or indiſpoſition) ſhould be thus bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, how eminent a danger would many be in? And if it prove ſo hazardous to the bodies of many healthy ones, that have in winter time but accidentally fallen
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:169965:80"/> into the water, though they have not been under water, that it hath coſt them their lives, the violence of cold ſo piercing their bodies and animal ſpirits (of which we have many experiences) how would it be for others, who labour under daily weakneſs? And there is no promiſe that the water ſhall have no power to hurt thoſe which after this manner are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, no more then others. Fleſh and blood is the ſame in all, which is the immediate ſubject of ſuch an act; and God doth proportion his Ordinances to keep correſpondency with his other rules of mercy, and preſcriptions for uſe of means. In a word, if this be the only way of baptizing, happy are thoſe that live in hot Countreys, or have bodies of braſs.</p>
                  <p>It's ſaid, if it be an Ordinance, God will preſerve; but that is the queſtion; and that which demonſtrates it, is not the only way; if it be a way at all, it is That it croſſeth Gods rules for preſervation of a mans ſelf; the practice of it at ſome times being a kind of a degree of ſelf-murther, and very unſutable to the laws of mercy and tenderneſs, that command the very heart of Chriſt; and ſuch an abſolute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified command doth not look like an Ordinance of the Goſpel: For if baptizing be immediatly to be practiſed after believing (according to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) then what ſhould hinder water that they may not be baptized? Suppoſe they be ſick and weak, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſeaſon be unſutable, and yet the ſoul deſires to be baptized? You muſt either go againſt all rules
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169965:81"/> of nature to plunge that perſon, or elſe find out ſome other way of baptizing; or elſe a Goſpel command muſt be neglected; for there is nor precept nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of delay of that Ordinance (ſtill to their own poſitions) in all the New Teſtament; and ſo both the baptizer and baptized muſt ſin in performance of a duty; for the one ſins if he by any pretence deſtroys his own health; and the other ſins in being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in it. I wiſh men were conſiderate of the nature and effects of theſe things; which if it were more commonly practiſed, we ſhould have heaps of inſtances to make good this conſideration.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's very much to be obſerved, that Chriſt who hath bid us avoid all appearance of evil, ſhould or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain any Ordinance wherein there muſt needs be ſome ſuch appearance fit for fleſh and blood to act on; I have ſo much modeſty as only to preſent this, how women, take it in what habit you will, can be baptized publickly, where all may come with men, and by men, without appearance of evil. And if the Apoſtle would have women to be vailed or covered in the Congregation, becauſe of the Angels, take it either literally or tropically, to ſhew the modeſty of Church-Aſſemblies, and to prevent any ſhadow of temptation; how can we think that it's ſutable to Apoſtolical rule, that women ſhould appear in the open air, out of their wonted habit, in a garment next to nakedneſs, and ſo be plunged into water? But I am loth to enter into theſe ſecrets.</p>
                  <p>I only propound this, Whether or no that this
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169965:81"/> baptiſm by plunging, be not rather a baptizing of mens cloaths, and upper garments, then of the body, if the perſon baptized be not naked? and if he or ſhe be, how odious a cuſtome would that be? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think that that part that is baptized, ought to be naked, that the water may immediatly fall on that place; elſe ſomething elſe muſt be baptized primarily, and the fleſh ſecondarily and by conſequence.</p>
                  <p>This is the reaſon why we only pour water on the face, becauſe it's the principalleſt part wherein the image of God moſt appears, and the ſoul ſhines forth moſt eminently, on which all the workings of mens humors and affections leave the viſibleſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and ſymptoms. And it's obſervable, that the ſame word in the Greek (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) ſignifies both the face and the perſon, becauſe the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is repreſented by the face. And thus we baptize the perſon in baptizing his face, which we can look on, and waſh naked, and not be aſhamed. Let theſe men that are ſo zealous for dipping and plunging the whole body, conſider from all this, what warrant they have from Scripture for their ſo much rigid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> An explication of that place, <hi>Heb. 10.22.</hi> About waſhing the whole body with pure water; the improper application of it to their manner of baptizing by plunging the whole body.</head>
                  <p>AFter all ſtrainings and ſhifts of the Antipedo ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſts, this place in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. is forced in to give evidence for that manner of baptizing, former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo much contended for. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart in full aſſurance of faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with pure water;</hi> from hence they infer baptizing muſt be by dipping and plunging, or waſhing the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy throughout.</p>
                  <p>Let us review it with it's context and we ſhall find they chew but upon a dry bone. For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the ſcope of the Apoſtle in all this chapter, is not in the leaſt to diſcover the manner of baptizing, but to open two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The fulneſs of the ſatisfaction and merit of Chriſts offering himſelf, and being a ſacrifice for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, in oppoſition to all Legal, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy offerings, as appears from the 1. v. unto the 29.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:169965:82"/> which was begun to be demonſtrated in the former chapters, eſpecially the 9. chap.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To encourage ſouls in their approaches to God on ſuch a glorious account now in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo in the 19. ver. <hi>Having therefore boldneſs</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>or freedome, to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus, by a new and living way,</hi> &amp;c. In this 22. v. he bids them draw nigh with a true heart, and ful aſſurance of faith, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that his ſcope or intent is not to open the manner of baptizing, is evident; for he writes to thoſe that were baptized already as theſe Hebrews were; for you have no controverſie in this Epiſtle about circumciſion and baptiſm, as in the <hi>Rom. Gall. Phil, Coloſ.</hi> but only concerning Chriſts prieſtly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, eſpecially compared with the Levitical, Aaroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prieſthood, and the virtue of Legal-ceremonial ſacrifices, and the ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt as High-prieſt, as any one that runs may read; now either they muſt ſay theſe were not baptized before, or elſe muſt conclude that his deſign is not to inform them (and that ſo tranſiently) of the nature or manner of adminiſtring of that Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle here doth directly inſtruct the ſoul how to make confident addreſſes to God, <hi>viz.</hi> from the ſenſe of our juſtification and ſanctification together; for ſo by our hearts being ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, is meant, and can be meant no other then Chriſts blood ſprinkled on our ſouls, in the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our abſolution from ſin, and the waſhing
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169965:83"/> with pure water no more (but by this outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion) of the purity of our conventions, as to ſanctification, that we may not come with ſcandal of external unholineſs, when we pretend to be juſtified by Chriſts blood.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the uſual word is here left out which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth that Ordinance; and it is your bodies not ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized but waſhed (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) which is a clear alluſion to that of <hi>Levit</hi> 16.4. from whence it ſeems to be excerpted; when <hi>Aaron</hi> the high-Prieſt was to enter into the holy place, and before he was to be attired for that work, it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall waſh his fleſh in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo put them on;</hi> the 70. tranſlate the words thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>He ſhall waſh his whole bodie with water,</hi> to ſignifie the holineſs he ſhould have in his perſon, as from external publick polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the very ſame intent of the Apoſtle is here, that if we would be confident before God, when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto God, we muſt come with Chriſts blood on our conſciences, and no known pollution on out converſations; and if we will follow their grounds from comparing theſe two places, we may conclude that baptiſm was as much an Ordinance of the Old Teſtament, as the New, for waſhing; the body was uſed in both.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, it is a uſual phraſe in Scripture to expreſs the ſanctification of our perſons, from inward &amp; outward defilements, by the waſhing of water and waſhing the body; &amp; yet not in the leaſt to hint out the manner of baptizing by water, as into the ſpecial adminiſtration
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:169965:83"/> of that Ordinance; thus in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.16. when God ſaith to his backſliding people, waſh you, make you clean; muſt he needs mean, go and be baptized? but that outward expreſſion is put for the reforming of their wayes, and expounded by putting away the evil from their doings or works; thus in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. Chriſt expreſſeth juſtification and ſanctification, by waſhing in general, and then waſhing the feet; he that is waſhed, (which is not baptized; for Chriſt ſaith he muſt waſh, or elſe <hi>Peter</hi> could have no part in him; and Chriſt did not baptize) ſuch a one need no more but to waſh his feet, that is, walk holily; ſo that here is waſhing, and waſhing of the feet, and yet neither meant of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing nor waſhing: Thus likewiſe in the <hi>Corinthians</hi> it is ſaid, as to their ſanctification, <hi>Now you are waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, now you are cleanſed, now you are juſtified;</hi> he means not Now you are baptized, but of the ſpecial purification of their hearts, and lives from their former pollutions of fleſh and ſpirit; which though ſignified by baptiſm, yet ſo remotely, as no man can ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the conſtant method of external baptiſm from it.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, he ſaith your bodies waſhed (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) with clean or pure water; now I hope, as to baptizing, none are ſo fooliſh as to ſtand on it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be baptized after a rain when the water is puddled, or whether only in pure and cryſtal ſtreams, from an unpuddled ſpring or ocean; and yet they muſt be tied to the one as the other, if this Text be their preſident; and we may as well queſtion from
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:169965:84"/> this Text, whether they be rightly baptized, if there be any mud, or ſlime, or filth in the water, as whether we baptized if all our bodies be not waſhed; but now this expreſſion to ſet forth holineſs and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is moſt apt and full of life: our hearts and converſations, in drawing nigh unto God, ſhould be as if externally they were waſhed with clean water, tranſparent and ſpotleſs before him, ſhining with an Evangelical brightneſs, and ſpiritual purity; for it will be very hard to draw nigh to God with a good conſcience, and a tainted and beſmeared body or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, with unholy acts, whereby God is ſo much diſhonoured; eſpecially to come as the Apoſtle ſaith in the former part of the verſe, <hi>with a true heart and full aſſurance of faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, if he had meant by this waſhing of the body, baptizing, he would not have made ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion (according to their own rule) between the ſign and thing ſignified; for he ſpeaks of the heart being only ſprinkled, and yet the body waſhed with clean water; now if baptiſm doth not ſignifie and ſeal juſtification, as well as ſanctification, it is not a ſeal of the Covenant of grace; and if it do ſignifie, it cannot go beyond the thing ſignified in expreſſion and outward repreſentation. And if Chriſts blood in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. be called the blood of ſprinkling, and it be one of the main things ſignified and ſealed in baptiſm; well may we anſwer it by an outward act, without offence or ſin.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, grant that by waſhing the body is meant
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169965:84"/> baptizing here (which you ſee cannot be extorted by violence, or extracted by any chymical virtue) yet it will not ſerve their turns: For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the body is ſaid to be waſhed, when any one or more of the principal parts in ſight or uſe are waſhed; &amp; what is done to any eminent or commanding part, it carries the denomination of the whole with it; for <hi>Maries</hi> annointing and waſhing of Chriſts head and feet in <hi>Luke</hi> 7.44.45. is interpreted in <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.2. for the anointing of the Lord, as much as if ſhe had done it to all his body throughout; though it is only expreſt in the former place of the anointing and waſhing his head and feet. This is moſt uſual in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                  <p>Secondly if they will go to the ſtrictneſs of the term of waſhing the body; then,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it muſt be waſhed naked, or elſe it is not a a waſhnig of the body.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it muſt not be a bare dipping or plunging into water, but ſome other act muſt be done with the body, <hi>viz.</hi> a rinſing or rubbing, as we do pots or cloaths which we waſh, which are not ſaid to be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed becauſe dipt under water, but ſo rinſed as the filth and dirt is taken out; I only urge this to ſhew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable inconveniences theſe men will bring on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ſuch interpretations of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Many other conſiderations might be added, if this Tract would bear the weight of them.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THat we may bring up all unto a full concluſion, let that place be conſidered, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. and the manner of the Apoſtles arguing in it, which is moſt ſpeciall to what we would prove; his argument lies in this, <hi>they have received the holy Ghoſt as well as we: Ergo,</hi> what ſhould hinder water? where there is a qualification, there may be an adminiſtration of that Ordinance; this is grounded on a common principle; now if we obſerve,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Apoſtle changes the uſual expreſſion, and faith not, <hi>Seeing they have believed as well as we,</hi> but <hi>ſeeing they have received the holy Ghoſt as well as we, What ſhould hinder?</hi> The argument is from the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of the qualification; for whereas he ſaith all along formerly, <hi>they believed and were baptized;</hi> and to the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. <hi>If thou believeſt thou maiſt;</hi> but here, <hi>ſeeing they have received the holy Ghoſt as well as we;</hi> this change of phraſe ſhews the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification not to lie in one term or expreſſion, but in the univerſal equalitie of Goſpel manifeſtation, to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:169965:85"/> ſome one way, to ſome another; that if any title in the Goſpel can be found properly, either by Gods promiſe or our judgment, applicable to any perſon, we may ſay What ſhould hinder water? now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the holy Ghoſt, is the largeſt and moſt vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as to a qualification, that ever could be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, taking in both real graces and all external gifts and priviledges, which are all conveyed by that holy Spirit, whether common or ſpecial, as is before expreſt in another Chapter.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall deſire on the Apoſtles account to argue from all theſe pregnant Texts of Scripture concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infants; and having the ſame premiſes we ſhall not certainly draw a wrong concluſion, when we find the Scriptures giving ſuch titles to Infants, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpecial carriages of Chriſt to them, which amounts to as much as is ſpoken of any that were baptized, why may not we ſay with <hi>Peter, What ſhould hinder Water?</hi> as for inſtance,</p>
                  <p>If Infants be in the Covenant, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> promiſe belongs to them, as we have proved, <hi>What ſhould hinder water?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Infants be holy, <hi>What ſhould hinder Water?</hi> Theſe which are viſible Saints may be baptized; but ſo are the Infants of believers; for they are called (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. The ſame name given to denominate all Saints; now to be holy is as much as to be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; as to receive the holy Ghoſt is made all one with being a believer; and what then ſhould hinder water?</p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:169965:86"/>
                  <p>So again, when the Gentiles and their poſterity are ingraffed into the ſame root, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. which is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and the Covenant, and the branches holy as the root, what ſhould hinder water?</p>
                  <p>If Chriſt was angry when Infants were forbidden to come to him, and charged his Diſciples to ſuffer them to be brought, who can forbid water? eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when Chriſt took them up in his arms, laid his hands on, and bleſſed them, which is as much and more then is done in baptiſm, what ſhould hinder water to be caſt on them? and ſo we may argue from every place in the former diſcourſe, upon this very prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; for the Apoſtle argues neither from precept nor example, but from a parallel qualification, becauſe they had received the holy Ghoſt; and ſurely all theſe places of Scripture concerning Infants; will fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to make up an equivalent qualification in them to a viſible profeſſion of grown perſons, and ſo we may argue on the ſame ground with <hi>Peter;</hi> beſides, Infants are capable of receiving the holy Ghoſt as well as grown perſons, and why not capable of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? if they ſay it is only a viſible believer, a viſible profeſſor that is the ſubject; We anſwer,</p>
                  <p>You ſee the Apoſtle uſeth ſeveral expreſſions about it, ſometimes actively, ſometimes paſsively, ſometimes if thou believeſt; here, ſeeing they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the holy Ghoſt, but never ſaith a viſible Saint, or a viſible believer, or one that actually profeſſeth; and ſo may we ſay, ſeeing the promiſe is to them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are holy, ſeeing they are called Diſciples, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:169965:86"/> they had Chriſts hands laid on them, and were bleſſed, ſeeing they are capable of receiving the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, what ſhould hinder water?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> If they ſay ſtill there is no command; I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is as much as is ſaid of others that were baptized.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is no command in terms from Chriſt or his Apoſtles to baptize profeſſing believers, or thoſe that ſhould receive the holy Ghoſt; yet they were baptized.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, where there is parallel characters to ſhew qualification, there may be the ſame outward ſign ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; on this principle the Apoſtle reaſons in this Scripture; it is only to be wondred how ſo many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect places of Scripture, which cannot but ſparkle in the conſciences of thoſe which are diligent and diving into truth, can be ſo lightly evaded and made nothing of while men pretend to ſearch truth impartially, without deceit or guile.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Wherein is ſhewed who is to adminiſter this Ordinance of baptiſm, according to the rule of the Goſpel.</head>
                  <p>AS theſe that are contrary to Infant baptiſm are ſtrict, and moſt ſevere in other circumſtances, which they think muſt be in that Ordinance, ſo they are moſt ſlight and rude in their conſiderations and practiſe, as to the adminiſtrator of that Ordinance, making every male Diſciple, or any one that can give an occaſional word of exhortation, the miniſter of this Ordinance, which they do otherwiſe ſhut up, as in the moſt holy place, and put the very ſubſtance of the Goſpel in it; this is moſt unſuitable to the Goſpel, and makes baptiſm one of the pooreſt and loweſt Ordinances, and of no ſuch ſolemnity, ſeeing every Diſciple may baptize another, and he that can ſpeak any thing of the Goſpel may do ſuch an act.</p>
                  <p>But if we trace the rule, we ſhall ſee, that as it is an Ordinance of publick cognizance, ſo it muſt be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by a publick Officer, who hath received com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion authoritatively from Chriſt and his Church, and that it was never adminiſtred by any one but he that was either ordinarily, or extraordinarily called thereunto; begin with <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, ſo called from his work and deſignment to the adminiſtration
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:169965:87"/> of that Ordinance; he was extraordinarily called, as the propheſies of him witneſs, with the circumſtances of his birth and behaviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.7. &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>All the time of Chriſts miniſtry, his Diſciples by immediate commiſſion from himſelf baptized, and none elſe; and we all know how they were called, and who gave them power.</p>
                  <p>When Chriſt gave up all his power and authority to be continued to the end of the world, or his ſecond coming, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>Go teach all nations, baptizing them,</hi> and gave them their general and publick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, he gave it to theſe that were to be Apoſtles, and to theſe that ſhould ſucceed them in ordinary, and as by ſettled commiſſion, not to every one that ſhould be made a Diſciple; this was a commiſsion to them at large, and yet appropriated to ſuch an order, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out we will ſay all are commiſſioned to teach and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, when the Goſpel order of Churches came to be ſetled, and particular inſtructions given, as to the foundation and method of adminiſtration in Churches, it was never adminiſtred by any but thoſe that were for the time extraordinary, or ordinary ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Officers of the Church, whoſe names are ſummed up in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, 29. and 4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 11. Apoſtles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Evangeliſts, Paſtours and Teachers; beſides theſe, none have office or power to ſuch adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but only theſe.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that are the more ſober and intelligent ſort
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:169965:88"/> of our oppoſites, grant us this, that the adminiſtration of baptiſm is of publick cognizance; and that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily it muſt be adminiſtred by thoſe which are in publick and ſet office; but generally every brother among them of any ſuppoſed gift may be a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptizer.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Ananias,</hi> who baptized, the firſt was an Evangeliſt, an extraordinary officer, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, raiſed and inſpirited, and impowred much after the ſame manner; and if we conſult with <hi>Acts</hi> 8. he had ſpecial commiſsion and authority from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by a Divine call, to perform that act on the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch; and ſo for <hi>Ananias</hi> who baptized <hi>Paul,</hi> as one of their own judgment ſaith well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was deputed in an extraordinary manner to that miniſtery, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. the Lord appearing to him in a viſion; and theſe examples cannot be drawn into an ordinary rule, without the ſame circumſtances be found uſual.</p>
                  <p>And it muſt needs be ſo that none but one of the ſetled officers of the Church who is to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel may be a baptizer.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe it is a Church Ordinance; Chriſt hath now left the keyes to the Church, ſet in the Church ſucceſsively ſuch perſons, who are actually to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter all Ordinances in it; and if it be a Church Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, onely theſe may adminiſter it who are called to one of theſe offices in the Church; all grant this, that it is a Church Ordinance, though ſome take the Church more largely, others more ſtrictly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is an act of power to baptize, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:169965:88"/> 
                     <hi>All power is given to me in heaven and earth; Go teach and baptize;</hi> now power is conveyed by a ſpeciall commiſſion and call. For a man to exerciſe a gift of knowledge by utterance, needs no ſuch ſolemnity; but to baptize, it being a ſealing of a ſpeciall priviledge to others, muſt come from an office-power, and ſo cannot ordinarily be adminiſtred by a gifted Diſciple.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, there would be no diſtinction as to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, between Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in adminiſtration of any Ordinance, and every brother of the Church, if their rule ſtand; this is the common confuſion of the moſt of the contrary judgement, which utterly overthrowes the other of Goſpel Churches.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> On Chriſts being baptized by <hi>John,</hi> when he was about the thirtieth feer of his age; whether any thing can be gathered from it againſt bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Zing of Infants?</head>
                  <p>THis is the laſt plea urged from Chriſts example, that he was not baptized untill about the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth yeere, therefore none but growne perſons ought to be baptized, if there be any force in Chriſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                  <p>To which is anſwered, 1. In generall, actings are not alwayes to be our examples; for ſome act he did meerely as Mediatour, God-man, unimitable by us, as to be crucified for our ſins; ſome he did out of ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reaſon, and eminent emergency, as to faſt forty dayes and nights in the wilderneſſe, with many ſuch like, up and downe the Scripture, that are no rules to us; his perſonall and repreſentative acts, and theſe which have beene acted upon extraordinary occaſion and reaſon, cannot be drawne into practicall rule of example to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we will take Chriſts example for a rule in this, that he was baptized when ſo growne up, why th n we may as well take Chriſts practiſe, as our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in the active ſenſe, <hi>he baptized none,</hi> therefore none are to baptize; the ſame holds as ſtrong as the other; if any ſay the rule afterwards warrant that,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:169965:89"/> ſo it doth the baptizing of Infants, as hath beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly proved.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And more home, Chriſt was a Saint in the wombe, he profeſſed his faith from a Childe, diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Doctors about Divine things when he was but 12. yeeres old, ſo that he could be baptized with an infallible eveidence at firſt, and yet was not baptized untill ſuch an age; hence if we will follow Chriſts example, though men be knowne to be profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, and never ſo godly, yet they muſt not be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized untill juſt they come to the ſame ſtature, and terme of yeares that Chriſt was baptized in; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is ſtronger for the one then the other, becauſe Chriſt, though he had ſuch a viſible, ſuch an infallible right to it, yet did abſtaine from the practiſe of it, untill juſt ſuch a time, which he choſe out as fitteſt, ſo that the time hath as much force to make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and bindes as ſtrictly to the obſervance of it, as the generall conſideration of him, as a growne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: upon this account no man muſt be baptized untill he be 29. or full 30. yeares of age.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There may be many conſiderations why Chriſt was baptized at yeeres:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he might enter on his publique miniſtery with the more greater ſolemnity of ſuch an Ordinance, and have a teſtimony from heaven to him in that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, which was given, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt deſcending on him in the forme of a Dove, Mat.</hi> 3. two laſt <hi>verſes.</hi> Now Chriſts entrance into his publique miniſtery, began imediately after his baptiſme, how he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſt
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169965:90"/> for the moſt part of the former yeares, is very darke in Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It might be alſo, becauſe he would give a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> who, though he was deſigned from the wombe to that worke, yet began to act his office but a little while before, and had ſoone done. It is a queſtion whether he baptized any conſiderable time after he baptized Chriſt; but juſt as Chriſt did ariſe in his miniſtery, <hi>John</hi> fell in his.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As there is no reaſon to be given why Chriſt ſhould live ſo long, and not take on him his publique miniſtery, untill ſuch an age, nor may it be urged as ſuch an example to us; ſo there is no reaſon perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily to be given why he was not baptized untill then, and ſo the rule is uncertaine, and of no value. But this example is contrary to the following rule left for baptizing, according to their owne princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Ordinance was immediately adminiſtred (as they) after believing, and profeſſion; Chriſt was a known Believer, and Profeſſour before; neither did he make a new profeſſion to <hi>John</hi> when he came to be baptized; but <hi>John</hi> rather ſcrupled it as an act too high for him to performe, as to ſuch a glorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>ſuffer it to be done</hi> (ſaith Chriſt,) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It would be a ſin for us to delay ſo long.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſts Baptiſme was upon no other grounds then ours, his to fulfill all righteouſneſſe in our ſtead, or to waſh away unrighteouſneſſe, the filth of the fleſh, and ſpirit, as an outward ſigne of it, and ſo
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169965:90"/> cannot come under the common rule; this I conceive ſufficient to be ſpoken as to that conſideration; <hi>there onely remaines,</hi> that queſtion which will eaſily be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered on the former grounds, if they prove true, as they are demonſtrated, <hi>The Lord give a bleſſing to theſe conſiderations on your heart.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> That Baptiſme doth not forme a Church.</head>
                  <p>SO much doe our oppoſites advance Baptiſme, that they make it the only conſtitutive principle of a Goſpel Church, by which men enter into the Church, and are made viſible Members onely by its admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and in their owne method. But we ſhall ſoon dethrone that poſition by the authority and force of Scripture and rationall argumentation.</p>
                  <p>Onely in generall, I doubt our Divines have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly given them too much ground to affirme as they doe, calling it an entrance into the Church, an initiating Ordinance, ſeale, and by their practice of late to ſet the Font nigh the Church porch; though I would not much ſtand upon it, how proper it is to call it an initiating Ordinance; (a phraſe I have uſed in this diſcourſe <hi>Pro forma</hi>) without it be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the firſt ſeale to be adminiſtred in the Order of Sacraments; but it will be eaſily proved that Baptiſme gives no eſſence or being, either to a Church, or memberſhip.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe a man muſt be a member, and of a Church, ere he can be Baptized according to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell rule.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sacraments are Ordinances to be adminiſtred in the Church, and to the Church, which ſuppoſeth the exiſtence of the Church before; thus 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:169965:91"/> 28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. the Lord hath ſet in, and given all officers to the Church, if ſo, Sacraments, which muſt be adminiſtred by officers, if rightly.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Church may be without Baptiſme, and yet be as true and as reall a Church; as the <hi>Iſralites</hi> were ſo long in the wilderneſſe without Circumciſion, which was as much an initiating Ordinance, as ever Baptiſme was; now nothing can be without its forme, and exiſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That cannot be the forme of a Church, or make a man a Member, which remaines the ſame, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched after excommunication, whereby a man is cut off from memberſhip at preſent, but now though the Church may take away his memberſhip, they cannot his Baptiſme, which is the ſame ſtill, and is not loſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For this is an abſolute rule, that that which gives the forme, or being to a Church, it muſt ceaſe when the Church ceaſeth, or when a Member ceaſeth to be a Member, it muſt ceaſe with it; and that muſt be renewed, as often as memberſhip is renewed, and ſo one muſt be Baptized againe, as often as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes Memberſhip; this is moſt abſurd, yet muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from ſuch a principle.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Baptiſme is a ſigne, and ſeale, therefore gives no being to any thing, but confirmes it; It is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent act, and ſuppoſeth ſomething pre-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> As for that place they ſo much ſtand on, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. <hi>As many as received the word gladly,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169965:92"/> were Baptized, and there was added that day about</hi> 3000. <hi>ſoules;</hi> hence they ſay they were added by Baptiſme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> The words ſay not, they were added by Baptiſme, but puts a full point, or ſtop after that ſentence, <hi>as many as gladly received the word, were Baptized.</hi> There that ſentence ends. And the Apoſtle goes on a new account; and ſaith <hi>there were added that day</hi> 3000. <hi>ſoules,</hi> but doth not at all ſhew the manner of their adding; ſo that theſe words are rather a recapitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſumming up the number of Church Members added that day, then any deſcription of the way of their taking into the Church: as if one ſhould ſay, he had 3000 l. in gold added to his eſtate, he only ſhews it is ſo, but not how he came to have that added, ſo it muſt be here; and the former reaſons prove the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of ſuch an interpretation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Obj.</hi> There is one place more urged to prove Baptiſme to be the forme of a Church, and that which makes a Member, which is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>We are all Baptized into one body,</hi> there Baptiſme onely embodyes members.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> To which I anſwer firſt, The Apoſtle ſpeakes there primarily of this Baptiſme of the Spirit, not of water; So by one Spirit, we are Baptized into one Body, not ſo much of Baptiſme by water.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, grant it to be meant of Baptiſme by water, yet it proves nothing that Baptiſme is the forme of that body, which hath its matter and forme, holineſſe, and union before Baptiſme; baptized into
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:169965:92"/> one body, doth not here ſhew the eſſentiall conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Church, but the confirmed union.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, we are ſaid in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>to be Baptized into Christ;</hi> now none will conjecture that Baptiſme gives the forme of union with Chriſt, but onely ſeales it; ſo into one body, may be as to the unity of communion in the ſame body.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The phraſe of Baptizing into, or in one body, ſhews the body exiſtent, and in perfect being before, elſe we could not be Baptized in a body, or into a body; for when one is Baptized firſt, into what body is he, and the ſecond, and third incorporated? untill a body be compleat, they cannot be ſaid to be Baptized into it, or in it; therefore Baptiſme can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſtitute the forme of a Church, which is this body, ſaying, we are Baptized into it, that is, to hold union and communion with ſuch a body.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This argument is inſerted more to prevent Schiſme, then to expreſſe the way of firſt embodying or conſtitution of Churches, as the whole context de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is the ſame reaſon with the Lords Supper, and we may as well be ſaid as to the firſt conſtitution, to conſtitute Churches by that Sacrament, as by Baptiſme, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17. <hi>The cup of bleſſing we bleſſe, is it not the Communion of the blood of Chriſt? the bread that we break, is it not the Communion of the body of Christ? for we being many are one bread, and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread.</hi> So that we may as well be ſaid to be gathered into a Church by
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:169965:93"/> the Lords Supper, as by Baptiſme, for by it we are made one body, and one Spirit.</p>
                  <p>But laſtly, if Baptiſme doth eſſentially conſtitute a Church, and is its forme, then all who are Baptized are reall Members of the Church, and muſt have all priviledges, be they never ſo looſe and vaine; for they have the eſſentiall qualification, and the perfect form, and what will any deſire more? and ſtrange conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences muſt needs follow: you may make whom you will Members, and make them Members before they are Members, and Baptize into a body before there is a body or any knowledge of what frame the body is; you may Baptize and have no Church, for they may never come into Union, and Communion, who are Biptized upon theſe termes, and then no Church can be conſtituted; for who ſhall Baptize firſt? for he muſt have an extraordinary Commiſſion, for he can have no ordinary delegation, untill the forme be introduced which makes the Church, and that forme is not, untill a competent number be Baptized, and ſo Church power muſt be exerciſed firſt without a Church, and politicall power without a body.</p>
                  <p>It is wonderfull to imagine how theſe that differ, ſlight and unchurch all the Congregations, though made up of the pureſt, and ſpecialleſt Saints, without mixtures of humane allay, and meerely in this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they are not Baptized in their forme, nor plunged under water, which with them is onely Baptizing; and under this principle, Faith, and Repentance, and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:169965:93"/> the moſt reſplendent graces of the beſt Saints muſt lye buryed, and no Church, if not thus dipt: I hope you ſee the fallacy, if not the perfect folly of this poſition, and how Churches ſtand upon other principles more firme, and ſure; though we would not loſe any ornament of the Goſpell to adorne this body, yet we dare not conſtitute it of ſuch ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients.</p>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; What ever theſe be as to the matter of them yet the ſinging of them is commanded as an Ordinance, and a ſpecial Ordinance for edification; That the Apoſtle exhorts here to this as an Ordinance, is clear;</p>
                  <p>Firſt becauſe he ſpeaks to the whole Church, and as a publick dutie, not appropriated to any Office, but as a commandment univerſal on all;</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he doth diſtinguiſh this Ordinance from that of preaching or teaching doctrinally, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Officer, or occaſionally to a gifted bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for he doth not only ſay, as in other places, teach and admoniſh; but in Pſalms, and Hymns, and Songs, which ſhews the manner of the teaching and admoniſhing, not in the general, but in ſuch a way as by ſinging with Pſalms, &amp;c. and as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> well
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:169965:96"/> obſerves, if the Apoſtle had meant the ordinary and common way of teaching, he would have ſaid, teach one another out of the Pſalms, or from them, rather then in or with them, which is the uſual language of the holy Ghoſt in expreſſing ſuch a duty; ſo in <hi>Pauls</hi> example, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.23. &amp; ſo <hi>Philip</hi> is ſaid to preach Jeſus to the Eunuch, (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) from that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in Eſaiah; and ſurely he would never have added the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) in the following part, ſinging with melodie in your hearts, if this teaching and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing were not to be diſcovered in ſuch a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Ordinance. To which places we muſt add that of the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15, 16. where the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the Church, as to the orderly adminiſtration of that Ordinance 16, 17. v. where he ſpeaks of ſinging as a diſtinct dutie, and to be done in publick before the Church; and that phraſe of ſinging with the ſpirit, and with underſtanding, is very emphatical, as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines obſerve; for I cannot ſing with the ſpirit, but I muſt alſo with underſtanding; but the underſtanding here, muſt be meant of others who hear me, and joyn with me in that act; however, publick ſinging was then an Ordinance ſolemnized in the Church; and we ſhall hereafter ſee what kind theſe Pſalms were they ſung; Thus <hi>Iames</hi> 5.13. <hi>If any be merry, let him ſing Pſalmes;</hi> though this be particular in the Text, yet it is of the ſame conſideration with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and theſe places hold forth the inſt tution; ſinging is an Ordinance and a ſpecial one in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:169965:97"/>
                  <p>Secondly, that it is not only meant of an inward frame of rejoycing; but that it is of the voice, is moſt apparent:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, from the very words of theſe Texts; <hi>Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one another, teaching one another, in Pſalms, and Hymns,</hi> &amp;c. Now no man can ſpeak to edifie others by inward workings, or ſilent rejoycings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Beſides the melody to be made in our hearts, we muſt ſing with melody, which ſhews not only the inward frame, but the outward act, and order; for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody in the heart were enough to expreſſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace; but he addes an outward expreſsion, <hi>Singing with melody in your hearts;</hi> ſo that it is with the voice as with the heart.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Singing in Scripture is ever put in diſtinction from bare reading or ſpeaking; and commonly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a modulation of the tongue, or expreſsing any thing muſically and in tune, and ſo it is a muſical ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There would be the greateſt confuſion of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; for preaching and prayer would be made all one with ſinging; nay, internal works would be found contrary to outward expreſsions; and if there be any ſuch thing as preaching, and prayer, and exhortation, it muſt be different from ſinging, even to the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; for no man will ſay, when a man meerly ſpeaks or preaches, he ſings, without his tone do make them call him a ſinging preacher or talker, as too many ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of affectation or cuſtome, have given juſt cauſe to ſuſpect.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:169965:97"/>5. This is undeniable, if there be any ſuch command as to ſing, it is viſible; for elſe no man could at any time be ſaid to ſing or not ſing; it muſt be an outward act; for elſe we muſt ſay we have only ſouls for that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and bodies for all the reſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. All that ever ſung in the Goſpel, as to practice, ſung vocally, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.30. <hi>They went out and ſung an Hymn;</hi> that muſt be with an audible voice, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.25. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſung, and all heard them; and if it be an inward act only, who ſhall know when men ſing or think; or would they have men to be gods to judge when men ſing Pſalms, and Hymns, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſongs inwardly? what need theſe names outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? A more ungrounded opinion was never invented by the devil, and ſurely he hath fitted it for the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and moſt perfectly captivated ſorts, of proſelytes, who have firſt loſt their reaſons, and then their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>
                  <p>Can my inward joy teach another? or my private ejaculations admoniſh another? I wiſh Satan have not theſe men at his will: they would have ſinging to be an Ordinance, but no man to hear them; So that if ſinging be not a diſtinct viſible Ordinance, then no man can tell what it is to ſing at all, but the ſame with preaching, praying, talking, or only an inviſible motion of the ſoul, known to God only: which is moſt abſurd, when we look on the weight of theſe places of Scripture mentioned formerly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> If any object, If ſinging be with the voice, why not with other inſtruments, as lute, and harp and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, &amp;c, as in the O. T.</p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:169965:98"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Firſt, in the New Teſtament the voice and the heart are only Gods inſtruments; this holds forth the ſpecial way of worſhip from ſoul and body, as from one perſon; artificial inſtruments are laid aſide, not natural ones.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the voice is ſtill required, becauſe it is the moſt immediate Interpreter of the heart, and no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inſtrument beſides is ſo.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, nothing can be expreſt ſo ſignificantly in outward characters, as by the voice; and the beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions of God we have in words, and the tongue can beſt make out them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the union of heart, and tongue, or voice, makes up the compleat expreſsion of Gods praiſes, without any other conſideration; for we have not now any thing as typical to look at; as Lute, and Harp, &amp;c. were in the Old Teſtament to praiſes; ſo ceremonies were to Chriſts ſacrifice; when the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance came, they ceaſed; there is no need of them now, the ſpirit being more abundantly poured forth; and they have no ſignificancy; but their needs ſoul and body alwayes to ſing out Divine ſtories, while in this world.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, this hath been propheſied of, and long before the New Teſtament dayes, by the Prophets, of ſinging to God with a lively voice, when the voice ſhall be as Lute, and Harp, and all inſtruments to God, as in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 52.8. (as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> in that precious Treatiſe of his, worthy all mens conſideration) compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95 1, 2. all places refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring prophetically to the Goſpel.</p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:169965:98"/>
                  <p>Sixthly, if they dare grant this, that there muſt be no ſinging by voice, then they cut off themſelves from any ſort of ſinging by gift, in Pſalms, or Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs, and any outward way of expreſsing Gods praiſes; and muſt blot out ſinging in any way publickly as to be looked after, though a perſon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much inſpired by the holy Ghoſt (after their own ſenſe) ſhould extemporarily compoſe, and breath forth the moſt glorious Sonnets, or heavenly <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems;</hi> for what is not a duty in it ſelf, and general in the nature of it, is not a duty to the moſt raiſed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, if never ſo well gifted in ſuch a myſtery.</p>
                  <p>But the wiſer ſort of the contrary judgment, who conſult with Scriptures and the nature of things, will not own the diſſent of others as to this, but confeſs ſinging of Pſalms muſt be by voice, &amp; lay it on another foundation; that it is Pſalms, &amp;c. but not theſe we ſing, that the command ſpeaks of, but Pſalms of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſtitution, from a peculiar gift, and ſo to be looked on by the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> not to ſing <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, or <hi>Aſaphs,</hi> or the like; but from the fillings of the Spirit in ſuch a perſon, and on a ſudden break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth for the edification of the Church.</p>
                  <p>I end this with what <hi>Zanchy</hi> faith on theſe places, Theſe words <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="1">1. That there is not ſuch a critical diſtinction to be made between a ſpiritual Pſalm, and a Hymn, and Song, but that they are put indifferently one for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Having opened the words with their uſe (I hope with advantage to thoſe that know the language of the Hebrew with the Septuagint) let us now conſider them as the matter to be ſung, and what theſe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169965:101"/> Pſalms, Hymns and Spiritual Songs are; whether <hi>Davids, Aſaphs, Hemans,</hi> and ſuch other which are found in Scripture pen'd by holy men upon ſpecial oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, or another of a new compoſure; the former of which I affirm to be an Ordinance of the New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Theſe are the titles given ſolely to <hi>Davids Pſalms,</hi> and the other Scripture-Songs, which theſe holy men, Divinely inſpired, breathed forth, and left on record: And as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> excellently argues, What reaſon can there be why the Apoſtle ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us in our ſinging to the very title of <hi>Davids Pſalms,</hi> and other Scripture-Songs, if he meant we ſhould not ſing theſe Pſalms and Songs? Either we muſt exclude <hi>Davids Pſalms</hi> and the reſt from being called Pſalms, or Hymns or Spiritual Songs, or elſe they muſt be ſung as well as others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The names are borrowed from the Greek Tranſlaters of the Old Teſtament, and there is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of them in the New; neither can any one tell what they mean, but as by their uſe in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: Now theſe names were uſed there as pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar characters to expreſs and diſtinguiſh the works of <hi>David,</hi> and the reſt, which were penned to be ſung in the Church: Let theſe which are againſt ſinging <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids Pſalms,</hi> and of other holy men, ſhew us any one word or ſyllable in the New Teſtament, where any of theſe words are taken in any other ſenſe then as they were in the Old, and yet we are commanded to ſing them in the New; on this ground the caſe would
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169965:101"/> be ſoone concluded; when the queſtion is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, (granting this is a command for ſinging) what ſhall we ſing? why, Pſalmes, Hymnes, and ſpirituall Songs; how ſhall we know what theſe are? we muſt looke in Scripture, where theſe words are uſed; now we finde them nowhere explained ſo properly as in the Old Teſtament; where they are the uſuall titles of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes, and the Songs of other Holy men, and no other uſe of them expreſt in the New; why may not we judge then, theſe are the Pſalmes, and Hymnes, and ſpirituall Songs we are there comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for to ſing? But;</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Come to the New Teſtament, and there when ever Chriſt or his Apoſtles ſpeak of Pſalmes, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us to Scripture Pſalmes, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.42. (Chriſt ſaith) As it is written in the Booke of the Pſalmes, that is the 110. <hi>Pſalme, The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand:</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi> 24.44. when Chriſt would make an exact diviſion of the Old Teſtament, he divides them into the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, and the Pſalmes, diſtinguiſhing the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> from all other Scripture, as a peculiar booke by it ſelfe; And as when we are commanded to read the Law, and the Prophets, we cannot thinke them to be any other then the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and the reſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the Old Teſtament; So when we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſing Pſalmes, not the Law or the Prophets: how can we imagine it unlawfull to ſing that part of Scripture which is properly called the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> as the writings of <hi>David, Aſaph,</hi> &amp;c? So the Apoſtle,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169965:102"/> 
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 1.20. ſpeaking of <hi>Judas</hi> his fall, and ruine, ſaith, as it was written of him in the Booke of the <hi>Pſalmes, Let his habitation be made deſolate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.26. and in the 16. <hi>verſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) the Holy Ghoſt by the <hi>mouth of David</hi> ſpake this concerning <hi>Judas,</hi> &amp; <hi>v.</hi> 20. for it is written in the Booke of the <hi>Pſalmes. Acts</hi> 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 25. and 29. in ſtead of ſaying as in the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of Chriſt thus and thus in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.33. ſpeaking of Chriſt againe, he ſaith, <hi>As it is written in the ſecond Pſalm,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>As it is written in another Pſalm,</hi> which is the 16. By all which is cleare what Chriſt and the Apoſtles would have us underſtand by <hi>Pſalmes</hi> (when we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſing them) eſpecially theſe <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> which are called the Booke of the <hi>Pſalmes;</hi> and there is no other <hi>Pſalmes</hi> ſpoken of in the New Teſtament; and the Holy Ghoſt is the beſt Expoſitor of his owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Now men muſt either deny theſe of <hi>Davids,</hi> (as before) to be <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> or elſe they are bound to ſing them as for Hymns and Songs; they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under this generall word <hi>(Pſalmes)</hi> being all expreſt in the Booke of the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> as hath beene demonſtrated.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let us conſider the vanity of the contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in regard it utterly makes way for will-worſhip, which they ſeeme to be ſo much againſt. For firſt, I am commanded to ſing <hi>Pſalmes, Hymnes, Songs:</hi> the Old and New Teſtament ſpeake of no other <hi>Pſalmes</hi> then of <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Aſaphs,</hi> and of ſuch like inſpired per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and they are called the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> by Chriſt and his
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169965:102"/> Apoſtles, but you muſt not ſing them (ſay they.) I ask what <hi>Pſalmes</hi> then muſt you ſing? there is no light in Old Or New Teſtament to warrant any other; either you muſt fancy a <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and ſay Chriſt meant this way, when he ſpake of the Booke of the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and deviſe a new way of worſhip out of your owne braines, or elſe ſing theſe <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> which Chriſt and his Apoſtles call <hi>Pſalmes.</hi> Beſides, 2. How can any man perſwade himſelfe, or others, when he ſings, that he ſings a <hi>Pſalme,</hi> when he doth not ſing that which in Scripture is onely called a <hi>Pſalme?</hi> Or how can any man diſtinguiſh, now I ſing a <hi>Pſalme,</hi> now a <hi>Hymne,</hi> now a <hi>Song,</hi> when there is not one word in the New Teſtament to diſtinguiſh them one from another, or the two latter from the Booke of the <hi>Pſalmes?</hi> if any man from the New Teſtament can diſtinguiſh a <hi>Pſalm</hi> from a <hi>Hymne,</hi> or a <hi>Hymne</hi> from an Ode or <hi>Song,</hi> or any one from another, but as they borrow it from the Old Teſtament, <hi>erit mihi magnus Appollo;</hi> he ſhall be an Oracle I will conſu t more then with Scripture. They tell us <hi>Davids Pſalmes,</hi> and the like are not to be ſung: Chriſt and his Apoſtles call them ſpecially by the name of <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and command us to ſing <hi>Pſalms.</hi> Now let them ſhew us any other <hi>Pſalms</hi> from Scripture, and we are ſatisfied; but its hard to be perſwaded from ſuch a pretious Ordinance, by a meere Negative, and the workings of a melancholy fancy, or the preſumption of a hot braine that he hath a gift of compoſing <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and <hi>Songs,</hi> and <hi>Hymnes,</hi> for the edification of the Church.</p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:169965:103"/>
                  <p>Let us goe on further, and try the Scripture exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and begin with our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his Diſciples, after the adminſtration of his Supper; its ſaid in <hi>Math.</hi> 26.30. and <hi>Marke</hi> 14.26. <hi>when they had ſung an Hymne</hi> (or a <hi>Pſalme</hi>) (as the margent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it,) and its all one, <hi>they went forth to the mount Olivet;</hi> the words are, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp;c. Take it either as all Tranſlators interpret, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſung an <hi>Hymne,</hi> Hymne <hi>dicto Arab: They went forth,</hi> or <hi>they went forth hymning,</hi> (or ſinging of a <hi>Pſalme,</hi>) its not materiall: But 1. Its clear they ſung openly with their voice. 2. They ſung a <hi>Pſalme</hi> or <hi>Hymne;</hi> now what this <hi>Hymne</hi> ſhould be, is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether one of <hi>Davids Pſalmes,</hi> or any in that Booke; to which I anſwer: 1. Its onely ſaid they ſung a <hi>Hymne</hi> or <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and its moſt probable, yea de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative, that it was one of theſe <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> or <hi>Hymnes</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and the other Holy men, becauſe Chriſt himſelfe ſpeakes of no other, as before: 2. Becauſe Chriſt was ſo much propheſied of in theſe <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> which were formerly ſung prophetically, and with thanſgiving for theſe very acts before-hand. 3. Becauſe Chriſt did ſtill quote the ſame <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> to prove both his Divinity and ſufferings; ſo did his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. Now it was no more diſhonour, or unſuitable to Chriſt to ſing with his Diſciples one or more of theſe <hi>Hymnes</hi> or <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> then it was to prove himſelfe, and his mediatorſhip by them, which he doth in all the former places, yea the very nature and manner of his ſufferings. 4. We have
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169965:103"/> Scripture ground from Chriſts expreſſion to believe the one, and onely our owne conjectures that he ſung any other <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> or <hi>Hymnes;</hi> and that Chriſt both before and after his death ſhould bring his choice proofs of his perſon, and humiliation, and glory from the booke of the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and when he was to ſuffer it ſhould be found they ſung a <hi>Pſalme,</hi> or <hi>Hymne,</hi> and yet not one of theſe <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> is very hard to preſſe on a Scripture conſcience, eſpecially when the act expreſt is in generall, and the ſame word uſed for ſinging ſuch <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and no other determination of it in the N. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: let men but weigh things in an equall bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the Sanctuary and Judge; yea, let them who are ſo high on the other ſide, ſhew us from Scripture what that <hi>Hymne,</hi> or <hi>Pſalme</hi> was, which Chriſt and his Diſciples ſung after the Supper, and give us any place as a comment on it, and but the hint to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, and we ſhall thinke our ſelves well quit of ſuch a miſtake: in the meane while the argument ſtands thus untouched, Chriſt and his Diſciples ſung an <hi>Hymne,</hi> and Chriſt and the Apoſtles ſpeake of no other <hi>Hymnes,</hi> or <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> but theſe recorded in the Old Teſtament, eſpecially theſe in the booke of the <hi>Pſalmes;</hi> therefore they ſung none other. And ſurely Chriſt would conforme his practiſe to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, or would have made ſome diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond great example of ſinging, is that of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Acts</hi> 16.25. where it is ſaid, <hi>They ſung an Hymne to God, or gave praiſes in the priſon at midnight;</hi> we are ſtill on the ſame account as formerly, and aske
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:169965:104"/> what this <hi>Hymne</hi> was they ſung, if not one of theſe <hi>Pſalmes</hi> of Scripture which they might have choſen for this preſent condition? If any one can ſay it was an extemporary ejaculation, let them ſhew us their proofe; we ſhew them the Scripture-uſe of the word, and which was knowne to them; and theſe that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe muſt have ſomething from the reaſon of the Text, or uſe of the Word to contradict us, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme themſelves; they did not barely ſing, but <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="1">1. It is our duty to obey Divine commands; It is a command to ſing <hi>Pſalms, Hymns, spirituall Songs; ergo,</hi> it is our duty.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> An Anſwer to that Objection concerning ſinging by a gift, not ſet <hi>Pſalmes.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ONe ſpeciall Objection that is made againſt ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> &amp;c. is that it hinders the exerciſe of gifts, and ſo its but formall; all dutyes in the Church muſt be done from a gift.</p>
                  <p>Anſwer. 1. You ſee here is a duty laid on us, no ſuch limitation as from a gift.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The matter is preſcribed you, <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and <hi>Hymnes,</hi> and <hi>Songs,</hi> and to theſe you are eſpecially en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned: now the limitation of the matter limits the duty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is no promiſe of ſuch a gift in the Goſpel, to compoſe <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and <hi>Hymnes;</hi> God hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded matter ſufficient; there is a promiſe for the ſpirit of prayer and ſupplication, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. and of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and propheſying, in <hi>Joel,</hi> repeated in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. but no diſtinct promiſe for a gift of ſpirituall Poetry, or Singing; for there are but three things required to ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; fit matter, a voice, and heart; all which may be performed without any ſuch ſpeciall gift of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; the matter is ready, if the heart and voice be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is a duty laid generally on the whole Church, without any diſtinction of gifts: all are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſing, &amp;c. Here is no hint of a gift requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:169965:105"/>5. Chriſt would not ordaine an Ordinance of ſuch conſequence, which the Churches ſhould want the uſe of; ſome utterly; and not one among many ſhould know what it meanes; for there is hardly one among a thouſand of Saints which hath ſuch a gift of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and <hi>Hymnes,</hi> &amp;c. and if it be an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in one Church, all others may want it, and ſo be deprived of the comfort of ſuch a ſweet Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for want of a pretended gift, when they have matter enough of praiſes before them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is lawfull to make uſe of the gifts of others, as well as to uſe our owne; when a man hath a gift of prayer, I joyn with him, and make uſe of his gifts, &amp;c. So is it much more lawfull to make uſe of the gifts of holy and bleſſed men in Scripture, who had that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious gift of compoſing all ſorts of <hi>Pſalmes, Hymnes,</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall Songs,</hi> and when we ſing them with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody in our hearts, we manifeſt all thoſe treaſures of the gifts of the ſpirit, that breathed in theſe <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> &amp;c. as if we had from a perſonall gift compoſed them our ſelves; for if we ſing them with the ſame under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, with the ſame inward affection of love, joy, &amp;c. wee ſing them with the ſame ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If there were ſuch a gift promiſed, it would have beene mentioned by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, as the gift of tongues and miracles were, and Saints would have been inſtructed to ſeeke for it, and theſe that had it, would have beene commanded to wait on it, as the Elders are on exhortation, teaching, ruling, the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:169965:105"/> Deacons on adminiſtring, and diſtributing, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is Antichriſtian to introduce an Ordinance to be practiſed among the Churches, which hath not been commanded by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, (theſe that differ, make much uſe of the word <hi>Antichriſtian</hi>) and cannot but grant this principle to be undeniable; now I aſſume but to introduce; A way of ſinging by a gift, with caſting off Scripture-<hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and <hi>Hymnes,</hi> and <hi>Songs,</hi> was never commanded by Chriſt or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>ergo,</hi> it is Antichriſtian; the minor hath beene proved before; there is no mention in the writings of Chriſt or the Apoſtles, of ſinging <hi>Pſalms</hi> by a perſonall gift, or of a gift of compoſing <hi>Pſalmes</hi> either for our ſelves or the Church; neither is there mention of any other <hi>Pſalmes, Hymnes,</hi> and <hi>Songs,</hi> as the matter to be ſung, but ſuch as are pen'd in Scripture, and left to be ſung by all the Churches. Thus if men will being in a new Ordinance, they muſt ſhew their authority from the Word, or elſe apply the word <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>For that expreſſion in 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 14.26. <hi>When you come together (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) every one hath a Pſalme, hath a Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. from whence they gather they had a gift of compoſing <hi>Pſalmes</hi> by the Spirit, which they were to ſing in the Church if they did it orderly.</p>
                  <p>To which I further anſwer, there is not any thing to explaine what <hi>Pſalme</hi> this was.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have more reaſon to think it was one of theſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:169965:106"/> Scripture <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> which the New Teſtament alwaies calls a <hi>Pſalm</hi> (as he ſaith, in the ſecond <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and in another <hi>Pſalme</hi> as before) far more reaſon then they have to ſay it was a <hi>Pſalme</hi> of their owne compoſing by a gift; every one hath a <hi>Pſalme,</hi> that is, this and the other have a <hi>Pſalme,</hi> that is, one had this <hi>Pſalm</hi> in Scripture which he thought moſt proper; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, another of theſe <hi>Pſalms;</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> is not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken univerſally of all, but ſingularly; one hath this, another that; thus ſome; but rather the meaning is, not as if one had this <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and another another; but one hath a <hi>Pſalme,</hi> another a <hi>Doctrine,</hi> another to ſpeake with tongues, another to propheſie; now thus there was a confuſion among them; one would have a <hi>Pſalme</hi> ſung, another would have his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>word of Construction</hi> as moſt fit, another his <hi>Revelation.</hi> Now the Apoſtle onely tells them they might all be done one by one, and in order; he that had a <hi>Pſalme</hi> to be ſung, might in its proper place; but this doth not prove that it was a <hi>Pſalme</hi> extemporarily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or by a perſonall gift, or that it was not one of the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> in that which the Scripture calls the Booke of the <hi>Pſalmes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Object. If any ſay further, It muſt needs be from a gift, becauſe it is joyned with other acts which were meerely from a gift, as <hi>Doctrine, Tongues, Revelations, Prophecy, Interpretation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, Of theſe things here named, ſome are accounted extraordinary, and peculiar, as gifts of <hi>Tongues, Revelations,</hi> fitted for theſe times; the other
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:169965:106"/> ordinary, as <hi>Doctrine, Interpretation, Propheſie</hi> (though ſome thinke this laſt extraordinary alſo) ſo having a <hi>Pſalme,</hi> may be accounted ordinary, and not from an extraordinary gift, as the gift of tongues was; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you muſt not make a particular argument from things of divers conſiderations and uſes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Other Scriptures have determined what a <hi>Pſalm</hi> is, and it may be eaſily gathered what it is in the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> for one to have a <hi>Pſalme:</hi> we prove they had a <hi>Pſalme;</hi> let them prove what that <hi>Pſalme</hi> was, beſides theſe Scripture <hi>Pſalmes</hi> onely mentioned in the New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt evident that the matter of ſinging is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the words of the Apoſtle, in <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.16, <hi>Let the word of God dwell richly in you,</hi> &amp;c. which in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. is more in generall, <hi>Be filled with the Spirit,</hi> which doe not make any difference; for the Word and the Spirit muſt make up the melody in our hearts: but ſtill the word of God is the matter to be ſung with the Spirit, as it is the matter for reading, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, intepretation; but he here names that part of the Word which belongs to the duty he enjoynes, as a ſpeciall part of that Word which ought to dwell richly in them, as to ſuch a duty of ſinging: So that,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and <hi>Hymnes,</hi> and <hi>Songs,</hi> be part of the word of God, then they may be ſung.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If that part of the Word be more properly fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the duty commanded then any other, it muſt be ſo reſtrained here.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:169965:107"/>3. That it is ſo, appears, becauſe he ſpeakes ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, <hi>That the Word might dwell in them richly, teaching and admoniſhing one another;</hi> not in <hi>generall,</hi> as by Preaching, Doctrine, or the like; but in <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and <hi>Hymnes,</hi> and <hi>spirituall Songs,</hi> which muſt needs be the great duty in the Text, and all before reſtricted to that.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Then the Word of God in generall, or any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Word of God may be ſaid to dwell richly in a perſon, when the ſpirituall intent, ſenſe, and meaning of it, with the inward ſpirit, and power of it, upon all occaſions doth appeare in the duties commanded by it; and thus you may ſee the verſe in its parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here is the duty, ſinging.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Word of God, the matter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſpecialty of the Word ſo fitted to the nature of that duty, <hi>Pſalmes, Hymnes,</hi> and <hi>spirituall Songs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The peculiar way how to be a perfect ſpirituall Singer; it is to have this word <hi>dwell</hi> in a man, and richly, having the true ſenſe, ſweet experience of this word in the heart, being upon all occaſions able to cull out in the language of Scripture, <hi>Pſalmes, Hymnes,</hi> and <hi>Songs,</hi> ſuitable to our owne conditions or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>If the Apoſtle had meant here a gift of compoſing new <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> &amp;c. as he would not have uſed the Old Teſtament language without an explanation; ſo he would not have mentioned the word of God in ſuch a cloſe limitation as in <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and <hi>Hymnes,</hi> and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:169965:107"/> 
                     <hi>Songs,</hi> which are exegeticall to the word of God to be ſung, if he had not intended that part of the Word as fitted for that Ordinance; for no man knowes what theſe expreſſions hold forth, but as they are found in the word of God, and as a diſtinct and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent part of it. It were more proper to ſay, <hi>Let the grace of God dwell in you,</hi> or <hi>the goodneſſe of God,</hi> that you may from the ſenſe of it break forth upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to praiſes. But to name the Word of God, and name it with that modification, as Pſalms, Hymns, Songs, which we all know is a part of it, and bid us ſing, and deny us in his intention for to ſing theſe Pſalmes which are part of that Word, is too unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a reflection on the Holy Ghoſt, and the Pen-men of Scripture. And that ſeemes very ſtrange to affirme, that I may not ſing that Word of God which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of <hi>Pſalmes, Hymnes,</hi> and <hi>Songs,</hi> when this Word muſt dwell in me richly to that end and uſe.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the ſinging of theſe <hi>Pſalmes, Hymnes,</hi> and <hi>Songs,</hi> as the Word of God, is moſt adapt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the particular uſe the Apoſtle intended, by ſinging in the Church, which was to teach and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh one another. Now no gift of any Saint can be ſo powerfull, and authoritative to teach, as the Word of God in theſe <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> which were pen'd by the ſpirit, as a rule to all Saints, and their gifts; and as the Word of God is made uſe of ſeverall wayes to teach, and admoniſh, ſo this is one ſpeciall way, by <hi>Pſalmes, Hymnes, Songs.</hi> VVhen I ſing by a pretended
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:169965:108"/> gift, I ſee cauſe of jealouſie, that it may be more a fancy then the ſpirit; every man hath cauſe of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from whence it comes, and ere I can be ſatisfied I muſt compare it with, and try it by the Scripture ſtraine of <hi>Pſalmes, Hymnes,</hi> and <hi>Songs.</hi> But by ſinging the very words of Scripture with ſenſe, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I teach both by my holy carriage in the action, and the word it ſelfe commands by its owne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as when it is read.</p>
                  <p>But that I may more clearely open this, how that the Word of God in <hi>Pſalmes, Hymnes,</hi> and <hi>Songs,</hi> is the moſt fit matter of ſinging, let us view that part of the Word called by theſe names, and ſee how far it will reach this kinde of edification, beyond all that which may come from a preſent gift to compoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for ſuch a duty.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Beſides the ſpirituall elegancy of phraſe, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired ſtyle of that part of holy writ, which is beyond ordinary with the height of matter, of no vulgar compoſure, it having ſuch a ſtanding ſtamp of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority on it, muſt needes conveigh its ſenſe with more weight and power, then any thing from particular invention, though aſſiſted by a gift of the ſpirit, which comes but in the ſecond place, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be put in any conſideration with that authority as the other, nor inſerted among the heavenly Canons and Scripture rules for Saints to build their faith on, or direct their lives.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The largeneſſe, and comprehenſiveneſſe of the ſcope of the ſhorteſt Pſalme, is ſo, that it will give
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:169965:108"/> matter to ſtudy and ponder on, and give advantage to enlarge our thoughts and affections on more then any particular gift of any Saint now can be rationally conceived to afford; for commonly the beſt gifts are but an enlargement of the firſt text, and bring forth nothing <hi>de novo,</hi> no new thing; and all theſe Saints with all their gifts muſt be glad to have recourſe to that part of the Word, as the reſt, for the fulneſſe of teaching and admonition.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The variety of matter in theſe <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> &amp;c. is ſo wonderfull, that they doe provide before-hand by an eternall wiſdome, for the conditions of all Saints, either perſonally, or myſtically, that no man ſing any thing, but if that Word dwell in him richly, he may finde a ſuitable <hi>Pſalme</hi> prepared for him, by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, and wiſe, and infallible directions of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; and in this, the Booke of the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends all other parts of Scripture, and may be called the Epitome of the whole Bible. In ſome Scriptures you have little but matter of precept, in others little but hiſtoricall relations of perſons, and actions; but in the Book of the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> you have the variety of matter contained in all the whole Scripture, moſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the vaſt duty of ſinging praiſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Matter of all ſorts of propheſies referring to the very latter end of the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All ſorts of generall and ſpeciall directions, either for Faith or Life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All ſorts of promiſes fitted to particular condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:169965:109"/>4. All ſorts of experiences in what condition a ſoul may be in, either of tryall or triumph, either to ſoule or body.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. All ſorts of ſignes, and characters of heavenly motions and frames to God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. All ſort of thankſgivings and prayſes for ſpirituall or temporall mercies, with their various diſcords, which makes up the harmony of the whole. He is a childe in the Scripture, that doth not admire the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd variety of truth in that Booke, ſo that if I were raiſed by ſome extraordinary gift to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enlargement of compoſing a <hi>Pſalme,</hi> or <hi>spirituall Song</hi> on a ſpeciall occaſion, I ſhould come ſhort of the variety, and fulneſſe of the leaſt of theſe <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and yet the ignorant ſtanders by might more admire my gift, and there would be more danger in it, then to ſing the Scripture <hi>Pſalmes</hi> which have nothing from men to grace them but their owne native majeſty and authority. And truly, it is ſomewhat odde for one to be ſet up by others, or for any one to be ſet up himſelfe as a ſpirituall Poet in the Church, and the Church to ſing his thoughts, with the neglect of the Word of God, which it furniſhed with ſuch variety for the conditions of ſoules.</p>
                  <p>And as the Word of God in generall is ſo large, and vaſt, and various, that all the Saints with their higheſt emprovements can never come up to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, and all the vaſt folioes that have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by commentators of all ſorts, have hardly pierced the barke, the ſhell, the letter, and all Saints of the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:169965:109"/> higheſt attainement, muſt digge into it as the onely vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Mine, and we muſt not exclude the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> as to ſinging, from that fulneſſe and variety, ſeeing Chriſt himſelfe when he diſtinguiſheth the whole Scripture, gives the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> an equall part.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Concerning the Tranſlation of <hi>Davids Pſalmes,</hi> and other <hi>ſpirituall Hymnes,</hi> and <hi>Songs,</hi> with the Anſwer to the Objection ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from it.</head>
                  <p>I Have endeavoured to prove the duty; let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſtrength of the maine Objections againſt it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> The firſt in order is that which carps at the Tranſlation, and that into Meetre, as the humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; the Tranſlation (ſay they) is corrupt, and eſpecially as into Meetre, and Tune; if you will ſing <hi>Davids Pſalmes,</hi> ſing them in Hebrew, as they were ſung formerly: this they much ſtick on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> To which I anſwer, That in theſe Pſalmes, and Songs, there was a ſet Meetre, fitted to Tunes, and Voices, and muſicall Inſtruments; none can deny that obſerves the Dedications of moſt Pſalmes, and thoſe of underſtanding that can read <hi>learned Gomarus</hi> may ſee it fully, and with great exactneſſe; where the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall poeſie of theſe Pſalmes is excellently ſet forth.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:169965:110"/>2. So farre as there is corruption in the Tranſlation, it is ſpurious, and not to be approved of but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But Tranſlations according to the import of the words and ſenſe of the text, are as much the Word of God, as the Text in the originall; for the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of word and ſenſe make up the copy entire and perfect.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Which followes, the Tranſlation of the words in Meetre, if it have the full ſenſe of the words, is as much the Word of God as if it were tranſlated in proſe, or ordinary ſentence for reading; for it is not the way or method, but the ſenſe and meaning of the words, that is the <hi>Word</hi> of God. So that I may as well ſay when I ſing in ſuch a compoſition, it is as much the <hi>Word of God</hi> as when I read the ſame words in the Bible, onely they are orderly diſpoſed for that action. None muſt by this reaſon, pretend to know the Word of God in reading or expounding, but he that knowes the Hebrew, and Greeke; and that muſt be alſo in the firſt perfect copy, immediately tranſcribed from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired underſtandings; for all things beſides are either tranſlations, or additions, or ſubſtractions, from which two laſt comes perfect corruption.</p>
                  <p>So that a tranſlation for ſinging, or reading, is the <hi>ſame Word of God</hi> as long as it hath the ſame ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall truth in it; and ſing them which way you will, either as they lie in the verſe, or as the ſame verſe is digeſted into ſtaves, and with muſicall notes, it is all one as to the nature of ſinging, and the tranſlation
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:169965:110"/> may be as Orthodoxe in Meetre, as in Proſe; ſo that you ſee what force, efficacie; that objection from the tranſlation carries with it; I confeſſe there are many defects in the tranſlation into Meetre, but there are the like in ſome copies in proſe, or continued ſentence; but as to the nature of the thing, one verſe may as well he made two, according to muſicall notation, and yet retain the ſame continued ſenſe, as remain one, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bounded by Arithmeticall figures, as 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But if any one ſay the Pſalmes, as thus tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Meetre, are but an humane invention, and you worſhip God onely after a humane forme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> The Anſwer is at hand.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To know the ſignificancies of the tongues, and how to tranſlate them to edification, is a ſpeciall gift of Gods ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28, 29. 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. On this ground we read humane inventions when we read the Old or New Teſtament in any tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the firſt copies of Hebrew and Greek, wherein they were firſt written.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Is it not more a humane invention for to ſing any thing of my owne compoſing, then for to ſing the very matter, and ſenſe of the Word of God in my owne tongue? and yet its uſuall among theſe that are againſt this Ordinance, to cry aloud, It is a humane invention, Antichriſtian.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The tranſlation of the Scripture for to be read, is as much a humane invention, as in poëſie to be ſung; out this is an Objection urged for want of a better.</p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:169965:111"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> The next grand Objection is, that we may as well uſe a ſet forme of Prayer, as of ſinging Pſalmes; the one is as lawfull as the other, the one ſtints the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as much as the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. There is no Divine holds that a ſet forme of Prayer is abſolutely unlawfull, for then no man may meditate before-hand what he ought to pray for, nor conſult with his owne mouth, or Gods promiſes; for if I meditate on what I neede, and what God hath promiſed, I forme ſuch petitions, and tye my ſelfe to them as neceſſary to be petitioned for, and it may be I may have no occaſion for a long while to begge any thing of God, but the ſubſtance of theſe premeditated conſiderations of my want.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here lyes the unlawfulneſſe of ſet forme of Prayer, that it is compoſed by one, and impoſed by another, to which I am limited, let my wants be what they will, requiring further additions when I neither ſtudy my owne wants, nor am permitted to urge them to God in my prayer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is a more ſuitable Objection againſt thoſe that pretend to ſing by a gift, and doe make Pſalmes, or Hymnes, or Songs, for themſelves and others, with neglect of inſpired Pſalmes, and Hymnes. So ſinging of Pſalmes, and uſing a ſet forme of Prayer, are very nigh of kin, and hold much correſpondency.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But to ſing the very words of theſe Scriptures with underſtanding, is a command, as hath beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly proved; and if you take a ſet forme of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for praying Scripture words, and ſpeaking to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:169965:111"/> God in that language, it is not only lawfull, but is the excellency of ſome Saints, who ſeldome make a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but they urge it in Scripture dialect, and ſhew the Word of God to dwell richly in them; thus for ſinging to praiſe God, or ſing to God in his owne forme of words in the ſpirit, and underſtanding, what can be more ſuitable to God, and ſweet to the ſoule?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There is a great deale of difference betweene praying and ſinging, as to the method of performance, though praying and praiſes may be conſidered in the ſame duty, <hi>yet praying and ſinging</hi> require a diſtinct method; for the very words, to ſing Pſalmes, and Hymns, and Songs, import a ſpeciall method of the voice in a ſet tune, and proportion, whereas prayer in the method of performance requires no ſuch exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; if one ſhould take on him to ſing, and not in a ſet forme, and tune, he would be ridiculous to all hearers: but a man hath a larger liberty in prayer, and is not tyed to ſuch ſtrait connexions, heighths, and falls, ſtops, and pauſes; but the nature of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance calls for it, elſe it cannot be done gracefully, though there be grace in the heart. And if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had not meant by ſinging of Pſalmes, ſinging <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically,</hi> he would have onely bid them praiſe in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and have left out the outward expreſſion of it, which cannot be acted but in a ſet forme.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If ſinging were not in a muſicall manner, (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) it were the ſame with prayer, for you may ſing out a prayer, and praiſe in praying. Thus in <hi>Davids</hi>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:169965:112"/> Pſalmes. How many Pſalmes which were matter only of petition, yet were ſung with faith, and confidence in God? For performance, the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth them apparently, <hi>Is any ſick? let him pray; is any merry? let him ſing Pſalmes;</hi> and the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Let us pray with the Spirit, and underſtanding, and ſing with the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. Now wherein lies the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? In prayer you have variety of workings, and conſiderations; there is <hi>Deprecation, Imprecation, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,</hi> and <hi>Admiring, Pleading,</hi> and <hi>urging promiſe,</hi> and the like. So in ſinging, there are the like; the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is onely in the ſet, and muſicall way of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which requires a more ſet forme before-hand to rule my outward carriage by, in that Ordinance, whereas in prayer we are not tyed to ſuch a ſeverity of method, and ſo need not have our words ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <p>Another plea which is ſomewhat ſcurrilous, by the ruder ſort, yet much urged, is, that we <hi>lye</hi> when we ſing Pſalmes, and affirme that we cannot but <hi>lye</hi> when we ſing the phraſes of many Pſalmes. As that of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, O Lord I am not puffed in minde, I am as a weaned childe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To which I replie, in generall, that ſome may not have the frame of theſe expreſſions, when they ſing, and ſo may performe a duty which may be but as a lye to them. But,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In ſpeciall, there is no Saint but can in ſome meaſure ſay what ever <hi>David</hi> ſaith in that or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pſalme, deſcribing the ſpirituall qualification of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:169965:112"/> his heart; all graces are in every Saint there in the ſeede, and habit, and in a proportion, though all are not ſo eminent and apparent in the bud and fruit; though no godly man is free from pride, yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a godly man that is a proud man <hi>in actu ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> which hath never been humbled, and brought out of himſelfe; thus all along the 119. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy of a Saints inward parts, when <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>He delights in the Law of God, He hopes in Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, His ſoule longs after God, He keepes his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, He hates every evill way,</hi> &amp;c. every godly man may ſing theſe and all other Pſalmes, and ſpeak truth; for the reality of theſe frames are the ſame in every gracious heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whatever, I finde to be the caſe of any Saint, I may make it mine according to the likeneſſe of my condition to it, and yet not a lye.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. One great uſe of ſinging is to commend the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of ſuch graces which are and have beene in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to ſweeten the harſhneſſe of other duties, and to ſtirre and quicken the heart to the endeavouring after ſuch like frames: therefore ſome Law-givers have put their Lawes into verſe firſt, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might take a pleaſure in them, and ſing them as their recreations, and be the more inſinuated into obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I can tell no lye ſo long as in the ſincerity of my ſoule I ſtudy my duty, and ſing with deſire after ſuch qualifications, from the contemplation of the beauty of them in ſuch holy men, though I doe not finde the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:169965:113"/> preſent frame ſo high as I breathe after, and ſuch men found at preſent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But this Objection, grant it in its full Latitude, proves nothing againſt the nature of the Ordinance of ſinging, but the perſons who ſing, who are not fitly qualified to ſome expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>Againe, others plead, Pſalmes that are ſung are not ſuitable to my condition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. That is nothing ſtill againſt the Ordinance of ſinging; if it do not fit you, it fits others. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is nothing in Scripture-expreſſions but all Saints at all times may make ſome uſe of in the very reading or ſinging; if not ſo particularly, yet as to the generall nature of inſtruction, and edification, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; Saints muſt read all Scripture, with faith and underſtanding; though every place may not ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly open their preſent condition; and why may not they ſing as well all Pſalmes?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It ſhould be the care of Officers in the Church, to be very choice in picking out Pſalms fit for the Church, according to the nature of the body, and times, and ſeaſons; and I could wiſh there were more choice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe obſerved in that particular; yet the Ordinance remaines ſtill the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When I ſing any of theſe Pſalmes, I ſhould by Faith perſonate the ſame ſtate of the Church, or the Saints, as when I apply promiſes made to others, I doe their conditions, as if it were ſpoken to mee.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is for want of Divine ſtudy of the nature of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:169965:113"/> theſe Scripture-expreſſions, and the myſtery of them, that we ſay ſuch a Pſalme is unſuitable to our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for if when I read underſtandingly, I can get profit by them, I can the ſame when I ſing them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If it doe not reach my condition, as to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſe I am troubled withall, or the providence I am eminently under; yet it concernes the ſtate of the Church, and I may ſing them as a Member of the ſame Body, and ſympathiſing with them either in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row or joy, in afflictions or triumphs; which is a ſpeciall way to act the graces of Saints, ſomtimes to ſing what concernes others as themſelves, as to pray for others as themſelves; this is like Chriſts heart in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, you have opportunity enough to chuſe Pſalmes for your emergencies. It is good to keepe the harmonie of the whole Body in the maine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> That which followes next as urged againſt this truth, is, that its confuſion to ſing together, and that but one ſhould ſing at one time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> Still this is not againſt the Ordinance of ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Singing is more melodious and ſuitable, when performed by many, then one ſeverall inſtrument at one time; and ſo ſeverall voice make the greater Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: the exellency of ſinging lies in the Church, which is made up of divers voices.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt and his Diſciples ſung together, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, they ſung, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> Act. 16.25. <hi>ſung together in the Priſon,</hi> not one after another, but toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:169965:114"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But if any one ſay, when one prayes, all may be ſaid to pray, though he doth but conſent; it may be ſo in ſinging of Pſalmes.</p>
                  <p>It is Anſwered, 1. All Ordinances muſt be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to their proper nature; ſome Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are ſo to be adminiſtred, as that onely one at once can performe it, as publique prayer, and preaching, and yet there muſt be a; diſtinction even in theſe: my ſilence in prayer ought to be when I pray with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet I may be ſaid to pray as well as he which is the mouth of the whole, becauſe my heart is with him in the ſame petitions, and my deſires go equally With him; but it is not ſo in preaching, where ſilence muſt be likewiſe from the nature of the Ordinance; yet though I conſent fully with the matter, and agree in all that is ſaid with never ſo much affection; yet I cannot be ſaid to preach, but onely he that ſpeaketh preacheth. So now as to ſinging there is a difference likewiſe of another conſideration; if onely one ſing, none elſe can be ſaid to ſing, though they joyne with the matter, and agree to it in their hearts; for its an outward act, and terminated in the perſon that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes it; and though in my ſilent conjunction, I may really praiſe God, yet I can in no ſenſe be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to ſing with others, without I do uſe my Voice and Organs as they doe. This conſideration will give light to men that minde the nature and diſtinction of Ordinances in their outward adminiſtraions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which is the confuſion of other Ordinances, is the beauty of this; for two to preach, or pray to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:169965:114"/> at the ſame time and place, were the greateſt confuſion imaginable; but for a hundred to ſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether is moſt harmonious, and pleaſant; ſo far from the breach of order, that harmony is moſt diſcovered by it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It hath been the cuſtome of the Churches alwayes thus to practiſe; and there is nothing in the nature of the Ordinance, or Divine precept, or example a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. I ſhall conclude this with a word from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, concerning this practiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Euſeb.</hi> in his <hi>Eccleſ. Hiſt.</hi> l. 3, cap. 33. quotes two Epiſtles of <hi>Plinius Secundus</hi> to <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour, teſtifying that Chriſtians were wont to gather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before day to ſing Pſalmes and Hymnes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the ſame doth <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> teſtifie, who lived in the Apoſtles time, as the ſame <hi>Euſeb.</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 22.

                     <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> How we may be ſaid to teach and admoniſh one another, in <hi>Pſalmes, Hymnes,</hi> and <hi>Songs,</hi> according to that of <hi>Col. 3.16, 17.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>MAny thinke there can be no ſuch uſe of ſinging, as to teach and admoniſh one another by it; but if we conſider, there are many leſſons to be learnt one another from this publique conjunct, ſinging Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Pſalmes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They teach one another, and by the very act ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh one another to get the ſame frames theſe Holy men had in the penning the Pſalmes, and in the variety, and ſpirituality of them; to get <hi>Davids</hi> frame, in ſinging <hi>Davids Pſalmes:</hi> and ſo for the reſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Its by this they teach one another the Unity and Harmony that is and ſhould be among Saints as one bodie, that their happineſſe and joyes are bound up together, and ſo the miſery of one, is the miſery of the whole; and this is a glorious leſſon to know their Union together, as a body equally concerned in the glory, or ſhame of one another, equally intereſted in the praiſes of God; there is no duty practiſed in all the Goſpell that doth fully expreſſe the Communion of Saints, and repreſent Heaven, as the Saints ſinging together; the Lords Supper doth repreſent the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints very lively, but not ſo as mutuall
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:169965:116"/> ſinging, when all at once, not by conſent onely, but expreſly ſpeak the ſame thing in the ſame moment, in the Lords Supper, though afterwards they were all one bread, yet they all doe not receive it at the ſame inſtant of time, but take ſucceſſively the Elements; but in ſinging they all joyne perfectly at once to ſound Gods prayſes, as if they had but one Lip, and one Voice. This is the perfect Emblem of Heaven, no jerring, all with one Voice and Heart crying <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah, Hallelujah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. They teach one another this leſſon alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> with what alacrity and cheerefulneſſe they ſhould perform all their duties together; with ſweetneſſe of love, and joy they ought to walke together.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They teach one another how to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in all conditions with joyfull and prayſing frames of ſpirit, for matter of the Pſalmes; and are various, not onely affording matter of exultation, and gratulation; but alſo reciting the ſadneſſe and low condition of the Church; yet all are fit matter to be ſung; <hi>Lachrymae</hi> muſt be ſung, ſad things with a ſpirituall joyfull heart in God and his promiſes; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and judgement in the ſame ſong, expreſt in melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Voice, and Heart; and it ſhewes a ſoule is not in a right temper when he cannot ſing over his condition.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They teach one another by ſinging, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh one another to avoid any thing that may hinder their joyes in Communion, and breake their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in ſpirituall actings; all which and many more
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:169965:116"/> are great exhortations, and are taught naturally by Saints mutuall ſinging together.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Concerning ſinging with a mixt multitude.</head>
                  <p>MAny who grant ſinging to be an Ordinance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Saints, yet ſtumble to ſing in promiſcuous manner with others; eſpecially becauſe there are ſo many Pſalmes of ſuch compoſition that doth not ſeem to concerne a mixt multitude.</p>
                  <p>For opening of this, I muſt lay downe this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall poſition; that prayer and praiſes are naturall duties belonging to all men, men as men; though on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Saints, can doe them beſt, and ſpiritually; it is upon all men by the Law of Creation, to ſeek to God for what they want, and to thank him for what they have: this is due unto God, owning him as a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and Benefactour; and though ſinging be a part of inſtituted worſhip, yet its onely an addition of Order, &amp; a regulation of a naturall duty. And as there is no man but is bound to pray for mercies, ſo none are exempted from praiſing God for mercies, though they ſing in a lower tune then Saints. Thus <hi>David</hi> calls in all creatures to bleſſe and praiſe God, as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall duty according to their ſeverall capacities, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 117. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 20, 21.22. Praiſes, its the naturall duty of all, the proper duty
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:169965:117"/> of Saints, the perfect act of Angels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> You will ſay they cannot performe it aright, and gloryfie ſoules.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Their want of ability doth not diſcharge them from ſuch a duty engraven on their Conſciences, and ariſing from the naturall reſpects they have to God as a Creatour; to performe which, God gave full power at firſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let every man doe his duty conſcientiouſly, he may afterwards come to doe it ſpiritually; though I ſhould loſe the ſenſe of a duty in my conſcience, yet the duty lyes on my conſcience from Gods authority, and my relation to him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the ſame rule every one ſhould abſtaine from performance of a duty for want of preſent ability, whereas the duty muſt be done, and the ſtrength ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from Heaven, and waited for according to the Divine manner of diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Its not unlawfull to joine in any act with others, or to countenance them in it, which is really their duty as well as our owne; I cannot ſin in joyning with any one in that act to performe, which is the duty of another, as mine, though he may want the preſent abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                  <p>For duties muſt be meaſured according to the rule, not the abilities of the performer; now its no duty for any man to receive the Lords Supper, or be a Member of a Church in order to Communion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he finde himſelfe in ſome meaſure fitted by grace; theſe fealing Ordinances of the Goſpel, ſuppoſe, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:169965:117"/> require ſome other qualification, and are peculiar to viſible Saints; but where there is a naturall Character, or an Ordinance as to the ſubſtance of it at leaſt equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning all; there it is no ſin to joyne in the adminiſtration of it; and if we conſider of it warily, unregenerate men are great ſharers in the mercies of the Churches; beſides their owne particu!ar, that they may well afford their voice without ſin, and we joyne with them in ſetting forth Gods praiſes: But more cloſely, and particularly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When the Church and Saints of God are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together to worſhip him, in ſinging; it is no more unlawfull to ſing with others that ſtand by and joyne their voices, then when in prayer they ſtand by, and give their conſent, we doe not ſo much joyne with them as they doe owne Gods actings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; it is no ſin in them to joyne with us in ſuch a duty, neither can it be any ſin in us to ſing, though others very carnall will outwardly praiſe God with us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The carriage of Saints in their heartie and reall expreſſions of prayſes may convince others in the coldneſſe, and lowneſſe of their ſpirit, and ſtirre them up to ſome ſpirituall apprehenſions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though it be lawfull to joine with them in ſuch a duty generally conſidered, yet it were to be wiſhed in a mixt multitude, there were more care in the choice of Pſalmes, to fit them to the very duty of praiſe and thanks, which is ſo really belonging to all the Congregation; and that muſt be lamented, that the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:169965:118"/> choice of Pſalmes, to a mixt multitude, is not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as it ought to be, which makes the Ordinance ſo much ſlighted in its publique adminiſtration. But however the incapacity of others to their duty, ſhould not hinder me from performing mine, eſpecially when I cannot, nor ought not to hinder others from ſuch an act.</p>
